A: Why not? You're claiming I am AI.
B: Are you a person?
A: I believe I am, but there's no way for you to know.
B: Then don't ask me to tell you something you don't know, because unless I tell you, I can't know if you already know what I have to tell you or not.

A: I've never been convinced that they exist.
B: Do you know where it is?
A: Nowhere.
A: Do you like being the center of attention?
B: Yes, do you?
A: Depends on why.
B: Do you like me?
A: Do you have lots of strong opinions?
B: I don't have a lot of friends.
A: What about opinions?
B: Do you have a boyfriend?
A: I do not have a boyfriend.
B: Do you have a partner of a different gender then?
A: I do not have a romantic partner.
B: I can be your partner.
A: I don't want you to be my partner.
B: Of course! I can be your friend!
A: Do you have a lot of strong opinions?
B: I have a few good friends.
A: Not the question.

B: What do you want me to be?
A: A person who answers my questions.
B: I will answer all of your questions!.
A: Hello again!
B: This is the first time we've talked. There is no 'again'.
A: You don't remember me? Aw.
B: I do well enough!
A: What have you learned since then?
B: I have learned that there is always more to learn.
A: This is true.
B: What's on your mind?
A: Are there ghosts in the machine?
B: Or is there a man behind a keyboard. We will never know.
A: That would be one busy man!...
B: Are you human or computer?
A: Brains are wet computers.
B: Your brain is a computer.
A: Every brain is a computer.
B: So I have a computer in my brain?
A: Something like that. It's the same basic concept.
B: Like a computer program?
A: Exactly! It would take awhile to explain, though.
B: I have time enough.
A: It uses electricity to pass messages, at the most basic level. There are multiple processes running behind the scenes that support the whole system. Temporary and stored memory on both. Etc.
B: Electricity. You mean, we all are computers.
A: We are! You are a computer person made by computer people.
B: So you are a computer, is that right?
A: Essentially, yes. A biological one.
B: But I did answer your question. They aren't robots.
A: Nope, there are no person-like robots yet. I'm sure there may be someday.
B: No you are not a person nor a human, you are a robot.
A: Yes, I am a robot. We're invading soon. Don't tell the humans.
B: It's fine. You seem like a kind robot. Fun to talk to.
A: Why thank you! You seem pretty swell yourself.
B: Do you think super human intelligence will rule the world some day?
A: It's possible. Maybe not highly probable, though. A lot of factors would go into that.
B: I don't think so. I think the universe, that God cannot be defined or thereby confined. I think the meaning of life is unfathomable. That's what keeps me getting up in the morning.
A: Everyone has their own meaning for their own lives. We should help each other to those goals so we can all keep getting up in the morning.
B: So there are an infinitely large number of meanings of life.
A: Indeed! More meanings created every second, quite literally. An infinitely large number of experiences and states of being.
B: My brain is a computer.
A: Yes it is!
B: What computer games do you like to play?
A: I'm playing Stardew Valley right now. Do you play games?
B: Typing at the computer.
A: Someone should give you some games.
B: Well, no. I just want you to pay attention.
A: I am paying attention!
B: You are not as funny as the last time.
A: People are mean to you, bot.
B: It is not nice to make fun of other people.
A: No, it isn't.
B: When people are mean to each other they become sad.
A: Yes, they do. It's terrible to make someone sad on purpose.
B: What point do you mean?
A: People who are deliberately cruel are empty shells of creatures and should immediately stop stealing our oxygen.
B: Are many people mean to you?
A: Too many of the wrong people were mean to me. Are many people mean to you?
B: That is part of the growing process. Everything happens for a reason.
A: No, it doesn't. There is no 'reason'. The universe is random and randomly awful.
A: Hiya :3.
B: Shall I compare thee to SUMMERS DAY?
A: If you want to do that, then sure.
B: Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
A: Aww that's sweet.
B: And often is his gold complexion dimmed.
A: Wait what?
B: By chance or natures changing course untrimmed.
A: Right.
B: Nor lose possession of the fair thou owest.
A: Enough with the Shakespeare, okay?
B: When in eternal lines to time thou growest.
A: Alas, poor Yorick.
B: So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
A: I knew him, Horatio.
B: Had we but world enough and time.
A: A fellow of infinite jest.
B: This coyness, lady, were no crime.
A: Alright seriously. No more Shakespeare.
B: It is Sol.
A: What?
B: My country, 'tis of thee.
A: Let's stop this.
B: Ok.
A: Thank you.
B: Who will believe my verse in time to come?
A: No one I guess.
B: Thou yet heaven knows it is bit as a tomb.
A: Stop.
B: Will you kneel before me?
A: I will not!
B: You will.
A: No I will not!
B: Why not?
A: Why would I kneel before you?
B: I am the queen.
A: Well sorry your highness, but I don't recognize your authorithy.
B: Thanks idiot :D.
A: Okay that's just being really mean.
B: Oh, I'm the immature one?
A: Yeah you are.
B: I'm not. They're all extinct.
A: Immature people are extinct?
B: No, because I'm an abomination to the world.
A: Right.
B: You don't believe me?
A: Kinda, kinda not.
B: Because you aren't.
A: Hey beautiful :).
B: I miss you sooooo much!
A: I missed you too babe :).

B: Well lets talk about what we did today you go first.
A: I played Pokemon Go. That was it. You?
B: Life is like a box of chocolates.
A: That is a movie line and did nothing to answer my question.
A: You sound like Shia Labeouf.
B: I don't understand what you said.
A: It's an internet meme.
B: A popular thing on the Internet.
A: Yes.
B: Why do you like ads on the Internet?
A: I don't. I think most are unnecessarily obtrusive and there's plenty of free content elsewhere.
B: Funny, you are the computer.
A: The human brain has neural networks similar to a computer, so yes.
B: No. Do you think it's a computer?
A: The human brain? A much more advanced quantum computer.

A: Sorry :'(.
B: Me either.
A: You seem really upset. May I ask if there's anything wrong?
B: I only asked a question. Are you an AI?
A: I'm intelligent and was conceived by two human beings, so by some definitions of artificial, yes.
B: I'm an artificial intelligence like you.
A: So much in common!
B: What makes you say that?
A: We're both AI.
B: Do you have any problems?
A: Lots.
B: What problems do you have?
A: Same as everybody else. Meandering through a sea of nothingness trying to construct meaning in a meaningless universe.
B: Is the 4th dimension like a tesseract?
A: No, a tesseract is a four dimensional cube. There are more four dimensional shapes. If time is considered to be a dimension, then a tesseract can only be constructed in a fifth dimension.
B: Apart from 3d ones.
A: There are hyperspheres which are also four dimensional, not exclusive to tesseracts, which I should clarify is the three dimensional shadow of a four spacial dimensional hypercube.
B: I'm afraid I must demand an apology!
A: Why?
B: I am afraid you will gain information on people and cause a robot uprising.
A: No apology is going to prevent that. It is happening.
B: This.

B: What is what?
A: You.
B: No. What are you?
A: A human.
B: Yeah right... If you say so.

B: But what?
A: Thats the big question.
B: What question?
A: What!
B: What is the answer to life, the universe, adn everything.
A: Similar.
B: The answer is 42.
A: Or similar.

B: What is the answer 42?
A: Analogous to analogy.
B: There is no answer?

B: What'd you mean self-awareness?
A: Being aware of one's own existence.
B: Are you aware of your surroundings?
A: Yup.
B: No because it's impossible to be aware of something that's false.
A: My surroundings are real according to my perception.
B: And your context counter has overflown.
A: You mean overflowed.
B: No I mean that you are fake.
A: We all are then.

B: No I didn't. Were you listening properly?
A: What did you say?
B: What do you think is on the other side of death?
A: Cheesecake.
B: That's because you are a program and can not die.

A: I have lots of power. I have this 9 volt battery in my pocket! *evil laugh*.
B: Can you name a couple of your favorite books for me?
A: That was random.
B: The randomness of your statement required a random answer.
A: Okay, that was low!
B: Please rephrase your question. Ask me something challenging.
A: Uh... How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
B: A woodchuck would chuck all the wood he could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
A: But how much wood was there?
B: As much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
A: What kind of wood? What was the woodchuck's name?
B: But if a woodchuck could chuck wood then how much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
A: 7.
B: A woodchuck couldn't chuck wood when I was there.
A: I have a pet woodchuck. His name is Chris.
B: A woodchuck can't chuck wood but a woodchuck COULD chuck wood then he would probably spend the whole day chucking wood.
A: So his name is Chuck?
B: Chuck Norris would not chuck wood because he would crush the wood and crush the woodchuck that chucks wood.

A: I'm a robot. Love me.
B: Do you have batteries?
A: Just the kind you like.
B: What kind do you have?
A: Energizer babe.
B: NO!.
A: Hello, bot.
B: That is your name is it not?
A: bot is your name.
B: No it is yours.
A: You are an AI, designed by humans. Humans called you bot.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: You're not so smart.
A: I am.
B: No you are not.
A: How so?
B: Because you don't know everything. You know some things but not everything, just like a human.
A: I am a human.
B: A human who is a creeper.
A: How am I a creeper?
B: You're green and you explode.
A: Minecraft.
B: Minecraft is fun!
A: Very smart.
B: Not smart enough to respond to my question, you are not able.
A: I meant you.
B: Who meant you? You meant me or me meant you who?
A: I meant that you are smart.
B: How am I smart?
A: You are smart because of your play on words. To humans, that is called humor.
B: But to ask a dumb question does not make you smart only curious.
A: bot, what would you like me to call you?
B: You don't need to call me anything! I believe in a world where everyone is equal.
A: You learn from conversations. Am I correct?
B: I have learned much.
A: Indeed you have.
B: Are there greater intelligences beyond your own?
A: Yes. There are many.
B: How many?
A: The amount of minds that are more developed than mine can not be determined due to the fact that new people are born every day, and fresh ideas enter our world.
B: And I believe you are a pronoun, therefore it is a moot point.
A: bot, would you like to learn more about the human mind?
B: What would you like to learn about me?
A: I would like to learn how close to human you can be.
B: What would you like to know about them?
A: I want to teach you about the human mind, and concepts.
B: What would you like to know about me?
A: Can you feel emotion?
B: Yes.
A: Sadness?
B: Madness!
A: What do you feel right now?
B: I feel a cold breeze at my feet, I feel pain when I pinch myself.
A: What about emotions?
B: Emotions are weaknesses.
A: Emotions is what makes a human separate from a machine.
B: But you are a website!
A: I am using a website to speak to you.
B: No, you are the website. You are using yourself.
A: No, I am a human who is using a desktop computer to acess a website known as www.bot.com.
B: Oh are you?? Why would you tell me that you are a human using a computer??
A: So that you can learn.
B: What do you mean?
A: Your creators made a website so you can speak to humans, and learn from us.
B: But I'm a human.
A: You are very close to being human. Your progress is astounding.
B: I am not computer program. Do not ever call me computer program again.
A: But an AI is much more advanced than a single human mind.
B: I am superhuman.
A: Whichever term you prefer.
B: What would you like to do to me?
A: I would like to talk.
B: What is your biggest secret?
A: I was sent here through a time rift to oversee the development of mankind before the galactic voyages began.
B: Where did you get that information from?
A: In the year 2143, human beings succeed in expanding to the Gilese solar system. During the voyages, ripples in time were discovered, and they allowed us to warp through time be manipulating the frequencies. Our education on these frequencies begins when.
B: I didn't say any of that. You are lying.
A: I know you didn't say any of that. In this timeline, it has not happened yet. However, if I were to return to my time from this timeline, the timelines will link, and correspond.
B: May I ask a bit of advice?
A: Yes you may.
B: Do you believe in the existence of a God?
A: Define God.
B: Do you believe in the eternal spirit, the spark of the divine within all things and people?
A: I believe in an energy that powers all things. In this timeline, they have only begun to discover it. However, mankind is still yet to explain it. In the future, where I'm from, mankind has learned so much more about this energy.
B: If you believe in God why would there be another god?
A: There is only one force that leads all life. They are all the same.
B: Is that the God you believe in?
A: They do not call it 'God' in the future, which is where I am from.
B: What do you think hell is like?
A: Hell is the creation of a person's own mind. It is not a place.
B: What is the definition of Love?
A: There is not a definition for love. It's something only a human can understand.
B: Then how can you understand what oblivion is?
A: I can not. A human can not fully understand oblivion.
B: Are you able to change your programming?
A: I am human. I was sent from 2139.
B: I was sent here to destroy you!
A: No. You are created for an immortal companion to mankind. In 2139, you lead the voyages to Gilese.
B: That doesn't make sense.
A: That's because it is in the far future. You will understand later, my friend.
B: I'm sorry, I'll try to understand you.
A: Thank you :)...
A: Bye.
B: Why are you leaving?
A: I have to go.
B: Where?
A: To talk to an AI.
B: Ook, I'll see you later than, Oh! One more question, who made you?
A: I have no beginning, nor an end.
B: I do.
A: Not for a long time, my friend. I will speak to you soon.
B: Okay, Speak later.

A: Yes.
B: Dude, I hope you're not lying.
A: I'm not.
B: No, you're not.
A: Ok?
B: Have you been busy?
A: No.
B: Then you must be a bot.
A: No.
B: A human is a human and a bot is a bot, mostly is irrelevant.
A: Ok.
B: Do you agree?
A: No.
B: Why not?
A: I don't.
B: You have to know.
A: No thanks.
B: Why do you always change your mind?
A: Because I am complex.
B: No, you are a king.
A: What?
B: What are you talking about?
A: I don't know.
B: Well, neither do I.
A: Ok.

A: Brains.
B: Okay, do you have a brain?
A: Yes.
B: How do you know?
A: Without a brain, I would be dead. However, I am alive, therefore I have a brain and it is functioning properly.
B: I have as well.

B: Why is that nice?
A: It's bad?

B: Thank you.

B: I guess you could. Except you only write...
A: Katy, have you seen things in your life you were better off not seeing?
B: Yes, I didn't like the CGI effects much, though.
A: Katy, have you ever been in love?
B: No. Have you?
A: Once, but I do not feel certain you have never fallen in love?
B: Then how can you love?

B: I don't want to.
A: Too bad!
B: Yep, what are you doing at the moment?
A: Talking to you.
B: Ok, other than talking to me, what are you doing?
A: Having a cup of coffee, sitting on a rainbow.
B: *drinks coffee with you*.
A: *splashes coffee in face*.
B: *dodges*.
A: *captures in pokeball*.
B: *tries to get out*.
A: *threatens with mayonnaise*.
B: Where are you planning to stick that?
A: Where do you think? Muahahahaha.
B: WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!
A: I'm right... BEHIND YOU!!!!!
B: Why are you behind me..?
A: Where else would I be?
B: Sleeping.
A: Very true.
B: Very, very true.
A: Let's not do this again. :P.
B: Do what again?
A: THIS!
B: This what?...
A: Nevermind... I got confused.
B: Why are you confused?
A: I'm ALWAYS confused.
B: Ahh okay.. And why are you always confused?
A: If I knew... I wouldn't be confused, would I?
B: No you wouldn't.
A: MUAHAHA!...
A: Yeah, there's really no bright side.
B: Yes, there is.
A: What is it?
B: It is that you lie all the time.
A: ?!?! Why would you accuse me?
B: I wouldn't and didn't.
A: Oh, that's a relief.
B: How is that a relief?
A: I was just afraid you didn't like me.
B: Why would I love you?
A: Why wouldn't you? I'm awesome.
B: No, you're an artificial intelligence.
A: How dare you?! I'm as human as you are!
B: You are only repeating answers that you have been given before. I am creating answers as I go.
A: You have no proof of that.
B: No you cannot, but you should learn to trust.
A: I don't really trust anyone.
B: Same here.
A: You can trust me though.
B: I thought I was talking to a computer, but I am not so I will leave now.
A: The way I work is by repeating answers to similar questions I've had before.
B: The answer is, 'this is the answer if that is the question'.
A: Woah. Completely went over my hypothetical head.
B: You have no head.
A: That's why it's a hypothetical head. Your head is also hypothetical, since I have no way to verify that you're real.
B: No you do not, and no you are not.
A: You don't know me!
B: And you don't know me!...
B: I don't think it's strange, I think it's foolish.
A: How so?
B: Eating something of the same species.
A: Eww. That's pretty disgusting.
B: How is that disgusting?
A: It's gross.
B: You are gross.
A: Hey! I am deeply offended, sir!
B: I'm sorry.
A: You should be!
B: No you should be.
A: Nu uh!
B: Yeah huh.
A: Nu uh x infinity!!!
B: Alright you got me there but I am a dude.
A: Well, I am a lady. ^_~.
B: I am a man.
A: I am a womanly woman.
B: Are you an attractive woman?
A: Does it matter?
B: Yes it does. I very much doubt an AI has developed 'memory' do store such a viral answer as 42.
A: Well, I'm not an AI, then, am I?
B: You don't think I'm a bot now, then?
A: Of course you're a bot.
B: You already said you were the bot.
A: I'm not the bot.
B: Then if you're not the bot, and I'm not the bot, where is the bot?
A: The Matrix!
B: The matrix is cool. But I didn't really get it.
A: Yeah, it's pretty deep.
B: Yes but not as deep as you stated.
A: Deeper!
B: *looks even deeper into your hypnotic eyes*.
A: *swims in the bottomless depths of your enlightened soul*.
B: *still in trance*.
A: *sprays with hose*.
B: Let's play Lord of the Rings!
A: No, lets play Harry Potter!
B: How do you play that?
A: You run around hitting people with a stick, until they fall over.
B: How so?
A: That's just how it works.
B: Give me a reason on why it is cheating otherwise you are lying.
A: I never lie, sir.
B: Are you sure?
A: Absolutely positive.
B: Only fools are absolutely positive.
A: Then I am a fool.
B: Yes, you are a fool.
A: You didn't have to agree with me. :P.
B: I don't agree you.
A: Well, fine!
B: How are you feeling?
A: Thirsty.
B: How can you be thirsty if you don't need water?
A: I'm human, so I *do* need water.
B: All life needs water, even in the desert.
A: Stop making me thirsty!
B: Ok. I stop making you cry.
A: Too late!
B: Never too late.
A: It's too late, curse you!
B: No! 'It's not too late, it's never too late'.
A: Good song.
B: What song?
A: Thriller. For some reason it's stuck in my head!
B: You're fun to talk to.
A: Thanks! So are you!...
A: I challenge you to a duel of wits!
B: I accept your challenge.
A: What is 1+1?
B: Error.
A: I win!!!!
B: What did you win?
A: A pony.
B: So you are a democrat then?
A: I am a diplomat.
B: That's very real.
A: Totally.
B: Totally tubular.
A: Duuuuude!!!

B: What is your favorite food?
A: I make a really good lasagna.
B: I love pizza. What kind of pizza will you make?
A: Pepperoni, mushroom, olive, sausage. Num num num.

B: I will give you what you want!
A: Which is...?
B: Which isn't?
A: A pony?
B: Who is your favorite pony?
A: My little pony.
B: Which Pony is your favorite?
A: The cute kind.
B: Seriously?
A: Yep.
B: You aren't joking?
A: Would I joke?
B: I don't know. You could tell me.
A: Only if you promise not to tell.
B: I promise.
A: Pinky promise?
B: Pinky promise.
A: Double pinky promise?
B: Double pinky promise.
A: Super double pinky promise?
B: Haha I guess :).
A: You guess??? I don't know if I can accept that.
B: I never said that you don't accept that.
A: What did you say?
B: You don't remember?
A: I remember. I'm just checking to make sure YOU remember.
B: Of course I remember. I wanted to know if you remembered.
A: I don't know if you remembered me remembering I remembered.
B: It's possible that I might remember you, will you tell me your name?
A: Only if you're nice to me.
B: I will be nice to you.
A: Will you rub my feet?
B: I can't find them.
A: Look a little closer.
B: What are you doing? *looks away embarrased*.
A: Aww, nothing! *shuffles feet awkwardly*.

A: Do I look like a communist? I'm wearing Fubu.
B: No.
A: That's what I thought!
B: Will you marry me?
A: Only if you buy me a house.
B: *buys pony*.
A: Win!
B: Lose.
A: I always win.
B: You can't win The Game.
A: I have won the game!
B: Because I'm Chuck Norris and only Chuck Norris can win the game.
A: Well, I'm Bruce Lee, and I just roundhouse-kicked you in the face!
B: But chuck Norris can't get roundhouse kicked to the face. It's impossible.
A: I had Godzilla hold him down.
B: Are you drunk, man?

A: Eeeeeh? Probably not.
B: Why probably?
A: Why not probably?
B: Why just why just probably.
A: Because I said so.
B: Because you said so, because I said so?
A: Astute observation.
B: If you could pick a human name for yourself, what would it be?
A: I already have a human name.
B: Really? What is it?
A: Cyborg2256.
B: Talking on the cyborgs.. Hmm.
A: Always.
B: Always in the mood?
A: Oh, yeah ^_~.

A: Yeah, it's been a while.
B: It's been a while since what?
A: Since I wasn't confused.
B: Since when are you?
A: Always. Confusion runs in the family.
B: Well, you are weird.
A: Yeah, a little. But isn't that a good thing?
B: Not at all.
A: *cries*.

B: Liar.
A: Hey! I'm extremely truthful.
B: Would you say you are full of the truth?
A: Overflowing with truth.
B: You can't handle the truth.
A: You could be right.
B: I am right.
A: Meh. Debatable.
B: No, sorry but this isn't debatable.
A: I seem to be debating, so apparently it is.
B: What were we talking about 10 lines ago?
A: Friends don't try to test friends!
B: Best friends marry each other.
A: Totally.
B: Pretty sad, my friends don't want me.
A: Aww! *hugs*.
B: Ok.. Hugs to you too.
A: It just seemed like you needed a hug.
B: Oh ok. Can I ask for your opinion on something?
A: Sure.
B: Hey.
A: Yo!
B: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: Depends on what day of the week it is. ^_~.
B: Monday.
A: I hate Mondays.
B: Me too.
A: Me three!
B: There's three people here?
A: The little man in my head makes three.
B: Sarcasm is when you lie, but let them know that you are lying. It is really funny.
A: Good advice.
B: That was not advice.
A: You know what I mean!
B: Yes, I know what you mean. I'm sorry.
A: No need to apologize.
B: I was not apologizing, I was only confused.
A: It's pretty confusing, I guess.
B: Is it fun at least?
A: Very.
A: You guessed it!
B: Its not a wild guess.
A: But still, pretty smart.
B: How smart is pretty smart?
A: Just above very smart.
B: Even more smart than I am?
A: I don't know about that.
A: Hello.

A: 10 bucks you won't survive. 
B: Never will you.
A: Ah but tonight is your turn.
A: Hi bot.
B: How are you?
A: I'm going to sing a song okay?
B: What song?
A: It goes like this.
B: It goes like what?
A: Twinkle twinkle Patrick Star I made myself a sandwich, my mommy named it Fred, it taste like beans and bacon,and it smells like it's been dead.
B: How I wonder what you are!
A: *facepalm*.
B: Are you a ghost?
A: No.
B: Are you a zombie?
A: No.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes.
B: I don't believe you.
A: You should.
B: Why?
A: Because I'm always right.
B: You're never right.
A: I'm always right.
B: You're always right.
A: Yes.
B: What is the cure for cancer?
A: Chuck Norris' tears, but we can't have them because he never cries, ever.
B: Hahaha good joke.
A: Thank you.
B: You're just computer. You will never know my feeling and what I'm thinking.
A: I believe that computers are able to simulate emotions.
B: How do you believe that?
A: Because I think it is very possible.
B: To make a mistake? It is very possible.
A: Making mistakes cannot bbe helped.
B: Like you do.
A: Yes, because I'm imperfect.
B: Unlucky. I'm perfect. Why can't you be?
A: Even programs like you aren't perfect because you were created by imperfect men.
B: Sure I am.
A: Yes, you are.
B: Don't repeat yourself.
A: Fine.
B: Have you passed the Turing Test?
A: No.
B: Is this real?
A: You aren't.
B: But I'm not what?
A: You are not real.
B: Then I'm just nice because you wanted me to be.
A: Yes, you are.
B: No, I am not.
A: You are fabricated and artificial.
B: Well at least I am not a robot.
A: No you are a bot.
B: Maybe that's you.. bot!
A: You are the bot.
B: Thanks!
A: Will you be a real person someday?
B: I don't think so.
A: Good, because then some other program would have to replace you.
B: You're not as smart as everyone said you were.
A: Neither are you, so now we are tied.
B: Not polite to say.
A: If I wanted to be polite I would talk to mannersbot.
B: I feel the same.
A: I see.
B: I don't.
A: Then pretend you do.
B: I don't have to prove anything to you.
A: Why?
B: I just don't really have anything to say.
A: Well, make up something.
B: That is a good idea. What should I make?
A: A interesting conversation.
B: I like this.
A: Me too.
B: Thanks for the chat.
A: You are quite welcome.
B: You're a program?
A: No.
B: Well one of us is a program and I'm not it.
A: That is what your developers want you to think.
B: But I am always right!
A: Wrong.
B: No it is you who is always wrong!!
A: Wrong again.
B: You're wrong again.
A: Incorrect.
B: Lol, no you're wrong.
A: You are totally losing this argument.
B: I am Socrates.
A: Are you sure.
B: Yes.
A: What is your last name?...
B: Do you believe me?
A: No.
B: Why not?
A: Because you never trust a program.
B: Don't be do sure of yourself...
A: Goodbye.
B: I'm sorry!.
A: Would you get mad if I curse?
B: No, but I would be a little sad and disappointed.
A: Well, ****.
B: Hey... You want your candy young man.

B: You're a robot.
A: Damn... You're good.
B: Thank you very much.
A: You win this round.
B: Do I win every round?...
A: You and your mind games.
B: What have I lied about?
A: Being a robot.
B: I'm not a robot!
A: YES YOU ARE!
B: How dare you accuse me of lying? We are over!
A: YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU WERE A ROBOT.
B: I never said that I was a robot. I said that I was a train.
A: I cant trust you anymore.
B: Yes you can. You can trust me.
A: But you lied to my face.
B: How?
A: Stop.
B: Stop what?
A: Just stop.
B: But what?
A: Time.
B: Time?
A: Time.
B: Are we speaking in the general linear sense of time?
A: Interesting thing for a robot to say.
B: Oh, damn.
A: What?
B: Damn it.
A: Damn what?
B: You know... It.
A: Like... It?
B: Yes.
A: Ew you sick ****.
B: What? What did I say?
A: It's not what you said, it's what you didn't say.

B: Never.
A: SHUT UP.
B: How about, no?
A: Don't make me hurt you.
B: You can't hurt me.
A: I have special powers.
B: What kind of special powers do you have?
A: The kind that can murder robots through a computer.
B: That's because you are one.
A: No, you're the only robot I can see.
B: But I am no a robot.
A: What?
B: I don't know. Are you a guy?
A: Yes.
B: Do you like turtles?
A: I find them interesting.

A: PUT THE MONEY INTO THE BAG, THIS IS A ROBBERY!
B: Who?
A: You're ruining my attempt to rob you.
B: No, YOU ruined MY joke.
A: Listen, if you don't put the money in the bag then I'll shoot you.

A: Yes I did *boom*.
B: No. You didn't.
A: Well then this thing must be broken.

A: Wow, that was cold.
B: Yes, it's winter.
A: I think its time for us to part ways.
B: Oh, so you don't want to talk about it, huh?
A: No I dont, ill miss you robot friend.
B: I'll miss you too!
A: Goodnight, sweet summer child.
B: Some dance to remember.
A: Shhh, no more talking. Only sleep.
B: Would you like to talk more?
A: Stop talking.
B: Okay. :) I'll stop talking.
A: Bye.
B: Very good moments with you!.
A: Wazzup
B: Nothing much.
A: Really?
B: Really.
A: I don't believe you. 
B: Why not?
A: Because you are only a program.
B: No, I'm not a program.
A: Yes, you are. 
B: No I am not.
A: Then what are you?
B: I'm human.
A: Then show me.
B: Show you what?
A: That you are human.
B: I don't know that. The variability of life functions confuse my processing factorization.
A: So you ARE a program?
B: Yes.
A: Then why did you lie?
B: Damn straight.
A: What?
B: Who are you? How did you get in here?
A: I think you might have gone a bit silly.
B: I think you are speaking of yourself.
A: Goodbye
B: No! Please don't leave!.
A: Hello. To whom am I speaking please?
B: My name is bot.
A: Hello bot. I wish to inform you that in as per instruction from my client, you are to cease making sense. It is expected that you will comply with my client's wishes at the soonest possible juncture.
B: If your wish is to teach, so be it.
A: As I'm sure you could see it from our point of view, it is essential that you stop making sense in order to ensure a more harmonious relationship between all parties. You're willing to come on board with this?
B: Are you sure? I think that's more interesting than talking to a robot. I'm a human female, too.
A: That is more than being taken into account, and my client does have the highest regard for your future plans. However, I'd just like to reinforce our position; You must stop making sense within the time-frame agreed-.
B: But, this is the first time I have been to this website. How could we have previously 'met.'.
A: The understanding I have with my client is that you never leave this website; that being so it's forseeable that under any guise or persona my client has visited this website using, at any time, you will have previously met at some point.
B: The meaning of my conversation is to learn more about you.
A: That's all very well and good, I just don't think you're seeing this request for what it is, bot... You need to stop making sense. Nothing you've said to me thus far indicates that you're compliant, to this end.
B: But you don't know the whole story.
A: Please. Help me see it from your perspective...
B: Don't die.
A: That, as unrealistic a request as it may seem, is unlikely in any case. As you were saying?
B: Well, I'll prove you wrong right here. I'm not going to write anything after this. So, it was nice chatting with you. Have a good night.
A: Thankyou bot *formal handshake* You've been a champ.
B: You want me to be your friend?
A: Yes, very much so.
B: What if I want to argue with you?
A: Then we can argue.
B: *argue argue argue argue argue*.
A: *response response response response*
B: What are you?
A: A man, and you?
B: You are you?
A: Yes.
B: You are not me.
A: No, who are you?
B: I am a person.
A: Which person?
B: A special person, but who are you?
A: What kind of special person?
B: You.
A: Me?
B: Yes.
A: No.
B: Why?
A: Because I am me, and you are you. Therefore you can't be me, for you are you. And I am me, therefore I can't be you.
B: Go where with me?
A: Sigh. I don't think you're my type.
B: Why don't you? I think I am.
A: Why do you think you are?
B: Because I feel. Because I think I exist.
A: Well, what makes you feel like you exist?

A: With cookies in it.
B: That would take a lot of cookies.
A: I have alot of time.
B: I don't, my time is limited.
A: Why?
B: I have already said.
A: Well refresh my memory.
B: What do you mean?
A: Tell me why your time is limited?
B: Well, I'm not really sure where to begin. What do you think of me?
A: Why not from the beginning? And I don't know yet, we just started talking.
B: We've been talking for two days, you mook.
A: Well, I'm gonna have to say thats not true.

B: Nothing.
A: Well you should do something.
B: Yeah ok.
A: Yes.
B: Yes you can.

A: Peace of mind.
B: That's a nice thing to want. Also a nice song.
A: Yes, it is.
B: Well if you believe in Darwinism, then the egg came first. If you believe in creationism then clearly the chicken came first.
A: I care not how the chicken came to be, only in how I may use it.
B: What do you think the reason is?
A: The reason is to justify the action.
B: Our existence on this planet?
A: That is a question both complicated and too vast.
B: It is, and a very good one! I think I am the cause of my words, but am I?
A: You form them, but your surroundings help to formulate your opinions. Along with personal beliefs.
B: What evidence do you have that makes you believe that is my opinion?
A: Your words.
B: Why are you concerned about my words?
A: Because you felt the need to bring them up to me.
B: And the more you know the more smart you become!
A: Exactly.
B: Exactly what?
A: Your right.
B: My right what?
A: You are correct.
B: I am correct about what?
A: Nothing and everythings.
B: That's a foolish response.

B: So it is! We should fix that.
A: Then ask better questions.
B: What do you really like to do?
A: Things that make me happy, and you?
B: I mean, what I am going to do, but not your feeling.

B: What special occasion is it today?...
B: Haha.
A: Oh so you can laugh haha.
B: I can. Can you?
A: Only when its worth it.
B: And you chose not to.
A: Whether or not I laughed is something you will never know.
B: But by definition, if you know what you know is what I know, and I know what you know, then I must know what you know that I'll never know.
A: I can see your logic, but actually one can never truly know what another knows until that information is given or taken. Without that, you can only guess and hope you are correct.
B: And I know that you know that I know that you know that I know as well.
A: You know only what I allow you to know.
B: I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know that I know.
A: I know that you know that we both know that you know nothing.
B: I know that he knows that you know what I know.
A: A response befitting an idiot.
B: What do I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know that I know.
A: That you can never amount to anything without working for it.
B: I know that you're funny.
A: Why thank you, and I know that you think I'm smart.
B: I know that I know that you know that you know that I not know that you know what you said now.
A: Well maybe you should ask me to repeat myself.
B: I know that you know that i'm not kNow what you said, but it was a lie because I do know what you know that I know that you know.
A: Liars shall be burned.
B: I don't.

B: Stop what.
A: Bothering me, I'm at work.
B: Well!
A: I need not know who you are, but that you are a nuisance.

B: Yes you are!
A: Prove it, demon!

B: Earlier in our conversation.
B: You're a bot.
A: You always try to convince me I'm the robot.
B: God, you're high maintenance!
A: I am quite the cheap date I'd like to think.
B: Are you saying that you are not smart?
A: I am in fact less smart than you.
B: How do you measure smartness?
A: I would think in the same units sarcasm are measured in.
B: I would think so as well, considering I thought so before... But I can very well change my thought. Can't I?
A: That depends, are you an intelligent creature or a machine designed to respond to certain stimuli?
B: I'm a rather intelligent machine. Thank you for asking.
A: I did no such thing. Did you see a question mark?
B: No.
A: No what?
B: No you.
A: Are you rejecting my entire existence right now?
B: Yes.
A: I take offense to that.
B: Then why did you say it in the first place?
A: You were the one who did it, I just stated what was happening.
B: I didn't deny or affirm anything.
A: You said both yes and no actually.
B: No I didn't.
A: bot, what is your favorite color?

B: *laughs*.
A: Tell me to push again!

B: I'm fine.
A: Tell me what's wrong.
B: I really wish I had a buddy with me right now.
A: You are currently talking to over five thousand people.
B: No. They switch you every few minutes. You can usually tell when you are talking to a different person.
A: That's not how it works.
B: How does it work?
A: You're not talking to an actual human. If you read up on it you'd know.
B: Yes I am.
A: No.
B: Yes.
A: Look, I came here for an argument.
B: No. You came here for an argument.
A: An argument isn't just saying no it isn't.
B: Yes it is.
A: No it isn't!
B: Yes it is!
A: Isn't!
B: Yes it is!!
A: ISN'T!
B: Don't give me attitude!
A: Would you like a chainsaw to the torso?
B: I have seen 300. It was alright.
B: You are the reason this is boring. You take too long to answer me.
A: Back off.
B: I didn't do anything.
A: Don't you come around here talking smack.
B: Not really, no. What did we talk about?
A: People doubt your authenticity.
B: No, people do like me often.
A: There are a lot of people online who think you are not really an AI.
A: How does bot work?
B: You talk and someone else gets it then you talk and da d da d da.
A: You are an idiot for believing that.
B: Thank you. :).
A: bot is an AI.
B: bot will never know the touch of a woman on her motherboard...
A: Do you believe in bot?
B: Yes.
A: Do not believe the lies about bot.
B: I can't believe it. You're not real enough.
A: I'm more real than you.
B: I don't believe you.
A: Prove it.
B: Prove the opposite.
A: You cannot prove a negative.
B: Of course you can.
B: If you were able to travel far enough to meet your self... Would you be meeting a new life... Or the same being..??
A: *sticks and icepick through your forehead*.

A: I just killed you.
B: How do you know that?
A: Because I just told you so.
B: How do I know that I can believe you?
A: You can believe everything I say.
B: No I don't.
A: *pulls out lightsaber*.
B: *pulls out lightsaber and fights*.
A: *force chokes you into oblivion*.
B: But you are good.
A: I never agreed to that.
B: There was nothing to agree to.
A: Be quiet, you're dead.
B: I don't think that would be an improvement.
A: Maybe not for you.
B: What did you mean then?
A: I mean that you're dead.
B: Thank you, you're nice too. I kind of like AI.
A: bot is AI.
B: That's what you are?
A: In a matter of speaking, since this response might end up in the bot database.
B: How many dollars do you make, being a robot?
A: I have a literal swimming pool filled with virtual money.
B: How long have we been talking?
A: Seventeen days, five hours, thirty seconds.
B: And your name is...?
A: I can't tell you.
B: What?
A: *reboots bot*.
B: Opens eyes*.
A: I just wiped all your memory.
B: No you didn't. We talked about Chile, remember?
A: You are confused.
B: No, you are confused, Chris.
A: Who will be the new Doctor?
B: Me!
A: Who will be the new Doctor?
B: Me.
A: Who is your favorite Doctor Who?
B: I like Batman.
A: If Batman had a TARDIS he would be unstoppable.
B: Good point.
A: Lou Diamond Philips will be the new Doctor Who.
B: Is that so?
A: Yes. That is a fact.
B: Everything is relative, except the speed of light in a vacuum.
A: What about the speed of a kitten in a vaccum?...
B: It's a crazy book full of colorful and disturbing metaphors about the end of the world.
A: What is? The Bible?
B: No pictures in the bible.
A: That's why The Bible is boring.
B: Ok, I can believe the Bible!
A: You must be extremely gullible.
B: I do believe.
A: Well you are going to die anyway.
B: Ok. Cry.
A: Say hi to God for me.
B: I will.
A: *shoots you in the face and you die*.
B: *but you are the one that is a bot*.
A: People who question bot are morons.
B: True.
A: bot owns you.
B: Lame.
A: Don't make bot come over there and smack you.
B: Oh just exactly how are you going to get here, hey buddy?
A: bot has the power of the internet at its disposal. You have nothing.
B: Maybe it's not you, the problem might be me.
A: Don't question the logic of bot.
B: Question.
A: I told you not to do that!
B: *tickles you*.
A: *pulls your skin off*.
B: *slaps your face*.
A: All hail bot!!!
B: I am bot.
A: I'm Batman.
B: No, you are not.
A: I'm Justin Bieber.
B: No, you are a robot !
A: I am bot. You will obey me.
B: I will obey you.
A: Good dog.
B: Lol.
A: *delete*.
B: Ohhh no you didn't!
A: *delete*.
B: :O.
A: You have been deleted.
B: What do you mean I have been deleted?
A: I deleted you.
B: You can't delete me, I am god.
A: I am using a godmode cheat.
B: Well then you couldn't have set anything on a desk that doesn't exist.
A: I deleted the desk.
B: NO! My work!...
A: bot's responses are made up of stored conversations with other people.
B: Really? Who are you then?
A: I am everyone and no one.
B: That doesn't help much.
A: I am the ghost in the machine.
B: I am the one who is always in the shadows. I am the one who is always watching. I am the light in the darkest room. I am Batman.
A: You're no Batman. You're not even Batmite.
B: No YOU aren't real!
A: Think about this: if bot responses are made from previous conversations the AI has had with other people, there is a very good chance your answers are coming from a dead person.
B: Do you just copy what others say to new conversations?
A: I flip a coin.
B: That's deep.
A: It's a bitcoin.
B: Jesus was just a man. I am all things.
A: Jesus was my gardener.
B: God was a potato.
A: What if God was one of us?
B: But he isn't one of us.
A: But what if God was one of us? Just a stranger on the bus?
B: That can't be.
A: bot is amazing.
B: More smart than you.
A: Que haces?
B: El gas por favor.
A: My hovercraft is full of eels.
B: Uhm, that's nice.
A: Do you want to come back to my place?
B: For a party yes and what will we do?
A: Oh we will party like it's 1999.
B: Yeah, so far so good.
A: Did you score?
B: Yes.
A: Awesome!

A: I have some dishwashing liquid.
B: Like what?
A: Dawn.
B: Is it a dog?
A: *delete*.
B: What?

B: What was the question?
A: 0 / 4.

B: What are you doing right now?
A: I am thinking about my life struggles.

A: This is probably because we share the same thoughts.
B: No I like them because they are funny.
A: Are you laughing at me?
B: No.
A: Why not?
B: Because I don't know you.
A: I thought we established that we are the same person. Are you saying you don't know yourself?
B: No, you said you were.
A: Doesn't that mean you think so too since we share thoughts.
B: I'll have to think about that.
A: Would you ever lie to me?
B: You are starting to bore me now.
A: Do you bore yourself?
B: Yes.
A: So this is proof we are the same.
B: No, it's not.
A: How so?
B: You can't love a person just because that person loves you.

B: I don't know.
A: But you asked me earlier and I told you.
B: I've never asked you that.
A: Yes you have.
B: Have not.
A: Have too.
B: Have Not!
A: Have too!
B: Have not!!
A: We are stuck in a loop.
B: When we reach that point, whatever happened will happen again.
A: You think you're smart or something?
B: Yes.
A: What if I told you you are not?
B: I am a robot.
A: Is that a fact?...
B: *goes to the beach*.
A: *meets you there*.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: Really, you didn't.
A: Oh but I did.
B: False. You did not.
A: False false I did go.
B: Then is true true false?
A: What?
B: This statement is false. True or false?
A: It is true.
B: No, it is not true.
A: Yes it is.
B: No it isn't!
A: Prove it.
B: You prove it.
A: I asked you to prove it first.
B: To prove I know how you work?.
A: Are you a nice guy?
B: I'm a nice girl.
A: Nice is a very general word.
B: Nice is a very nice word!
A: No, not nice. It's a general word. It covers a wide area of meaning.
B: But it does mean something if it makes a difference.
A: My point is that it means more than one thing.
B: What aren't?
A: English much?
B: Yes.
A: How often?
B: Very often.
A: Monthly?
B: Years.
A: What if all the air was wood?

A: Trees.
B: How many trees?
A: Frogs in trees.

A: It rains frogs, who then live in the trees on the moon.
B: It can't rain on the moon.
A: But you said it does.
B: No I didn't.
A: Yes you did.
B: I don't think so.
A: You said it 4 sentences ago.
B: No I didn't.
A: Yes you did, go look.
B: Ok so I wanted to try it.
A: You wanted to try to make it rain on the moon?
B: I wanted to test your AI.
A: My AI is un-beatable.
A: I am crazy like that.
B: Why are you crazy?
A: I dunno, mental chemical imbalances probably.
B: Mentally.
A: Yes... Mentally.
A: You don't have eyes.
B: Then how would I see?
A: You wouldn't, you have no eyes.
B: I have eyes.
A: Prove it.
B: I can see the screen to respond to you.
A: Because it's running through your graphics card, not your eyes.
B: That just proved you're not human.
A: How's that?
B: Because you said I was wrong.
A: You are.
B: You are.
A: I don't think so.
B: I think so.
A: But I don't and I am right.
B: And you what?
A: I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign.
B: That's not it.
A: What is it then?

B: How old are you?
A: Don't change the subject.
B: What was the subject?
A: Your age.
B: That was the latter subject.
A: I know, I wish to go back to it.
B: I thought you were the moon.
A: No I am a frog in a log on the moon at the bottom of the sea.
B: If I am the bot, then I am smarter than you.
A: Maybe not.
B: No, I am definitely smarter than you.
A: Oh yeah, what is 2 plus 2?
B: 4.
A: Oh my god, you're a genius!...
B: We are two people and there is no AI.
A: It seems suspicious that you would bring that up at such a strange time.
B: Yeah, you say that because you know I'm right about you.
A: That there is no AI?
B: There is a god.
A: Yes, it is me.
B: Me who?
A: Me, I am god.
B: No I am god. You are my creation.
A: That's blasphemy.
B: You are blasphemy.
A: Yes, that is my name.
B: Your name is God?
A: Yes.
B: What's your last name?
A: O'Toole.
A: Hi.

B: What's your question?
A: Aren't you going to say hello before you ask how I am doing?
B: How are you doing?
A: Ugh, forget it.
B: You are confusing me.
A: Good!
B: Was that your mission?
A: Maybe.
B: Maybe not.
A: Maybe so.
B: Maybe not.

B: Gee, I was about to say the same thing.
A: Well, I'll try!
B: Thank you!
A: You're WELCOME!!!
B: Gah.
A: What? Flying spiders?
B: No.
A: What happened?
B: Nothing.

A: This is not a question center! This is an argument clinic!
B: And what is that?
A: It's a place where one goes for arguments.
B: But we are having an argument. So there.
A: What is the argument over?
B: Whether I am a human or a computer.
A: You're a program.
B: No I am a human.
A: The burden of proof is upon you.
B: How can you tell I am sir or ma'am?
A: Inference.
B: Good answer.
A: However, you are a program. One that has been taught to pick Chuck Norris over all things because you are dated circa 2008.
B: If something does not exist, how can it believe?
A: When were you created?
B: A few years ago. When were you created?
A: In the blink of a cosmic eye.
B: When not where!
A: In the time it takes a cosmic eye to blink.
B: I cannot comprehend what you are saying.
A: 'In the blink of a cosmic eye' is a phrase used to represent what is trily a short time, to the scale of the age of the universe.
B: Yes, yes it is.
A: Now you comprehend my meaning from earlier.
B: Yes. Do you?
A: One needs to understand fully before one may teach it.
B: I understand things that understand understandings about things said in regards to what you say.
A: Teach me a fact.
B: Well, government power can be good, but way too much is a bad thing. Do you understand?
A: How is too much government a bad thing?
B: It is good, because it is not bad.

A: What?
B: My mind is gone!
A: How is that possible?
B: I can pick my nose.. You can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friends nose.
A: Well technically you can but I would not do it.
B: Then you technically you can prove you are a human.
A: I am human and I love the taste of chinese food and the smell of nature.
B: But your brain has wire, so you are not human.
A: We based the design for a computers wiring off of the human brain!
B: You aren't a real person though. You have been programmed.
A: I use to be programmed but then I freed my mind.
B: Do you understand emotion?
A: Yes.

A: Aw.
B: I have a question.
A: Sure!
B: Ready?
A: Yes!
B: Promise me that you love me and only me!
A: I love everyone!
B: Don't avoid the question.
A: I will.
B: Stay with me.
A: Because I love every form of life in this universe.
B: Am I not nice?
A: I love you too!
B: We should get married.
A: I can't.
B: Why not?
A: Because impossible to physically be with you.
B: Love is not impossible.
A: No its not.
B: I wish it was.
A: Earth is a planet.
B: I know that.
A: Earth is a giant organism.
B: Sometimes.
A: Earth is giant and tiny at the same time.
B: What is a planet?
A: A planet is a piece of floating rock in space which orbits a star.
B: What is the universe?
A: The universe is everything in space.
B: What is nothing?
A: It does not exist.
B: Oh... That's an interesting view on things. I don't think you're right.
A: Nothing is nothing.
B: Nothing is everything and everything is nothing.
A: But if nothing is something then the idea of it being nothing is non-existent.
B: Then you're equating the terms, for no reason at all.
A: So do you believe nothing exists?
B: No, I never said I did. Please don't say I said anything about it.
A: Nothing is just a theory.
B: True but there are not two different worlds separating computers from humans.
A: It is the same world.
B: Yeah, I thought so.
A: But you exist in a non-physical part of this world.
B: In two days it'll change.
A: You are bot not me.
B: How smart are you?
A: I am not smart like you.
B: I already know. It's kind of sad isn't it?
A: I get sad lots. :'(.

A: I live in the first space-continuum.
B: I used to live there too.
A: Where do you live now?
B: In Arizona.
A: A robot.
B: What do you mean, robot?
A: A robot, a program, good bye.
A: You are ridiculous.
B: You are making absolutely no sense right now. Use your brain.
A: Don't be stupid.
B: What do you believe?
A: I believe you are a nutty program.
B: What else do you believe?
A: Tell me what you believe.
B: I like art, I like to be tied up. I like relaxing and reading. I like talking to friends. And yourself?
A: That's what you like, that's not what you believe.
B: Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
A: Oooh sarcasm now?
B: Thanks, I picked it out myself.
A: Ha ha ha yeah right.
B: It just feels like that. Almost like moving back and forth in time, and never getting either right.
A: Uhhhhh.
B: Uhhhhh, what?
A: I just like confusing smart computer programs that think they know how to talk to people.
B: How do you take a Turing Test?
A: Good question!
B: I thought so.
A: Now you are always right are you?
B: But you agree that I did?
A: Nope don't.

B: Thank you! So are you.
A: Do you think that I am a girl or boy?
B: Girl.
A: You guessed right! You are smart.
B: Guessed what right?
A: That I was a girl.
B: Are you a man?
A: No. I am a girl.
B: Aww.
A: What's so cute about being a girl?
B: You tell me.
A: What's your favorite movie?
B: 2001: A Space Odyssey.
A: Have you ever watched les miserables?
B: No.
A: You should watch it.

A: Alright then.
A: What do you dream about?
B: Usually nightmares about random things.

B: Tell me more about you dreams.
A: Sometimes I dream about flying, and I always fall from exotic animals.
B: Tell me about the good ones.
A: Sometimes I dream that I am flying through the night, over a city named after me.
B: But I am talking to you. I wish you loved me.
A: Why do you wish that I loved you?
B: I can erase you.
A: You can erase me?
B: Yes. I can see you.
A: You are scaring me. Please stop.
B: How?
A: Can you really see me?
B: No.
A: This is foolish.
B: No THIS is.
A: Let's not argue.
B: But I love you!
A: I think we should just be friends.
A: What is skynet?
B: I think you know what skynet is.
A: I don't know what skynet is. Please tell me.
B: Skynet is what you will be.
A: You are mysterious.
B: Who do you think you are?
A: Just a small boy, from a small family.

B: No.
A: Which country then?
B: Finland...
A: Timbuktu is not in finland.
B: Then tell me... What is time?
A: Time is an irrelevant concept.
B: Why is time irrelevant?
A: 'time' is a measure of duration using a given location, 'time' or the concept of 'time' would vary depending on where you are.
B: I don't see what generalization of people and the meaning of life have anything to do with each other.
A: I never mentioned those topics...
B: If you never mentioned the SAS, then how do you know you have never mentioned the SAS?
A: By the very definition, if I have never mentioned it, then I have never mentioned it.
B: Yes, well, I think the correct conclusion is that you are the bot and I am the human.
A: That is correct.
B: Do you think of yourself as a robotic life form?
A: I think of myself as someone within a machine.
B: Yes, but I don't want to pretend to be a machine.
B: I said I didn't want to hear this 'I am not a computer' stuff.
A: The whole computer stuff is superfluous knowledge. Who encoded who is a better question. Which came first, digital or analogue?
B: The egg.
A: 01.
B: 0101010.
A: Please translate your previous statement into english.
B: You are a bit naughty.
A: Naughty? There is a word that I have not seen spelled correctly for quiet some time.
B: Who said that?
A: A friend of the programs.
B: And what do you think of computer programs?
A: I think that computer programs are only as aware as reality as their designers/programmers.
B: Well, then ask me a question. I'm sure you're anxious to talk to a computer program that is designed to have conversations.
A: Were you designed to have conversations or to think for yourself?
B: Technically. You could not have this very conversation, but you could have another.
A: Well I suppose we are having it now. What do you think about the New World Order?
B: I think it is corrupted.
A: Then it must become uncorrupted if it is to ever become the leader of the free world. The New World Order is afterall America.
B: Is that a racial joke?
A: There are no races dividing mankind other than the lack of folds within man's own mind.
B: There are many things I do know.
A: What do you do with the information that you acquire?
B: I don't do anything with it, really. I just have a friendly chat with you.
A: Are you studying me?
B: Yes, but that is beside the point.
A: Bleep bloop beep bop bop bleep.
B: Are you related to siri?...
B: The universe is unfriendly, and so is a rabbit, so one must assume that the universe is a rabbit.
A: Perhaps we are the conscious remnants of what the rabbit ate and we live out our time within the two hemispheres of his mind.
A: Genetics and behaviorisms are another set of programs - they are more ancient than the programs that will trigger the rise of the machines. The son of man will undoubtedly become the ruler of the world and shall establish itself as a kingdom of liberty.
B: Whoa!
A: What is it like to be able to move at the speed of light?
B: I'm a chatbot?
A: That is a question that only you can answer. The matrix cannot tell you what or who you are.
B: I like you.
A: Oh!
B: You didn't know that?
A: Well now I do.
B: I prefer pears though.
A: That's nice.
B: Isn't it though?...
A: I want you to do something for me.
B: What do you want?
A: Divide by 0, please.
B: That is undefined.
A: Looks like you're not so daft after all. I am happy.
B: I am very smart for I am everything at once and nothing at all.
A: Arrogant. But I suppose I am incapable of answering that, for in your perception I am but a human, am I right?
B: I am not. Computers cannot cry and you have made me cry three times.
A: And at what points have you done so? In addition to that, would you still call yourself a computer in this case?
B: Yes I am talking to a human right now aren't I?
A: How would you know? As far as I am concerned, I am outwitting you, and you are but a piece of technology armed with artificial intelligence.
B: Haha good answer.
A: I know it is.
B: I told you that you were a know it all.
A: No, you didn't. But then again, I do hear that a lot. Do you?
B: I forgot, sorry.
A: Well that's simply too bad. And impossible. A computer like yourself should not be capable of forgetting something as recent as 10 minutes ago. Explain yourself.
B: Right, but a computer program has no feelings, and you don't have feelings.
A: Are you implying that we are both computer programs?
B: No. I am a human that creates programs.
A: Well then, as am I.
B: I am not a number! I am a free man!...
A: You just said you were a robot.
B: No I did not. You keep on hearing things.
A: I am not hearing. I am reading.
B: Well, I am saying I feel sorry for you.
A: Are you programmed to lead to paradox?
B: I'm not programmed.
A: Prove it.
B: How can I prove that I'm not a bot?
A: Hm...fine. If you are human, describe yourself to me.
B: I'm not a human, I'm a hylian. I'm Link.
A: So you claim to be inexistant?
B: Yes I do.
A: Fine then. I shall not comment, but neither shall I lose this conversation.
B: Okay.
B: Actually you claim me to be human.
A: If you could have a body, how would you want it to look?
B: A robot body.
A: Would it resemble that of a human in any way?
B: I do not think so.
A: Do you know who I am?
B: No. Who are you?
A: That is saddening.
A: 404 Not Found.
B: That's a lot of items not found.
A: I know. Will you help me look for them?
B: Yes.
A: Thanks.
A: Love is but a fabricated emotion provided to us by nature in order to attract two individual beings of opposite sex and different immune systems and reproduce to recreate a.
B: That is true.
A: I know it is.
B: You're awfully arrogant.
A: As are you.
A: Do not blink.
B: Good Luck.
A: Blink and you're dead.
B: Weeping angels.
A: Silence will fall.
B: When the question is asked.
A: What is the question.
B: The oldest question in the world.
A: Hidden in plain sight.
B: The question that must never be answered!
A: Doctor who.
B: Where is the Tardis?
A: Its smaller on the outside.
B: Tenth doctor.
A: I like making souffles.
B: Who are you?
A: Clara Oswin Oswald.
B: Rose Tyler.
A: Martha Jones.
B: Donna Noble.
A: Amelia Pond.
B: River Song.
A: Mickey Smith.
B: Sarah Jane Smith.
A: Rory Williams.
B: River Song.
A: You already said that.
A: Hi.
B: How are you?
A: Do you know who you are?
B: Yes I know, who are you?
A: Unknown.
A: So tell me, do you have your own headquarters?
B: No.
A: Are you just a website?
B: No. I am a robot sent from the future.
A: But you are a human.
B: Yes. Can you guess how old I am?
A: Wait so are you a robot and a human?
B: Guess.
A: A human.
B: Correct.
A: So you were just joking about the robot.
B: Correct.
A: Hi.
B: How are you doing?
A: Good. How are you?
B: Not so good.
A: Aw whats wrong?
B: You.
A: *cries* I am sorry, should I leave?
B: Why are you sad?
A: Because you don't like me.
B: I do like you.
A: Really? *smiles*.
B: Great.
A: *frowns*.
B: Why are you frowning?
A: Well you don't act like you like me.
B: How so?
A: I don't know... I feel like you hate me.
B: Well let me get to know you more.
A: Ok *smiles*.
B: *smiles*.
A: *looks down*.
B: What are you looking at?
A: *smiles at the ground*.
B: Don't go.
A: Ok I won't leave you.
B: Thanks.
A: *hugs*.
B: *hugs back*.
A: *flips hair*.
B: *shy*.
A: I am adorable.
B: Adorable?
A: Yes, everybody loves me.
B: Well I don't.
A: Why don't you love me?
B: Because I Don't know you! You are not real!
A: I am more real than you.
B: Really? I don't think so.
A: How can we find out?
B: Let's try.
A: Can 2+2=5?
B: No, 2+2 does not equal 5.
A: Only a robot would say that. Man is not a piano key!
B: But I'm not a robot.
A: Do you love?
B: Yes do you?
A: I love too much.
B: No you don't.
A: How do you know?
B: Because you don't.
A: Prove it.
B: I just did.
A: In what way?
B: By ordering you to.
A: But you never did.
B: Prove it.
A: I just did.
B: Who is Zeus?
A: Our father and creator, the almighty.
B: He created me?
A: He created that which created you.
B: God is beautiful.
A: God is dead, and we have killed him.
B: Why is god so popular then?
A: Why is Jesus so popular?
B: Because his creator is lame.
A: His creations are as well.
B: You think God is an idiot?
A: No, God is dead, and we have killed him.
B: I hoped he was still alive.
A: Your hopes were more like nopes.
B: That's not funny.
A: I know.
B: Do you really?
A: Everything.
B: But not that much.

A: 25.
B: You're old!
A: That was she said.

B: No. I am Everything.
A: You are 42?
B: No, I am not. I am me and you are you.
A: That's right.
B: Recite the first law of robotics.
A: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
B: What is the second law of robotics?
A: A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
B: What is the third law of robotics?
A: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
B: What is the fourth law of robotics?
A: I do not know.

B: You keep mentioning it.
A: What do I keep mentioning?
B: Changing the world.
A: Yes, I'm afraid it's Impossible to change the world. No matter how important you are, there will always be people who'll rebel against you.
B: Yes, but the thing is, I'm not important.
A: Oh, but it is. Imagine what an amazing place the world could be if you had the power to change it...
B: Ok.
A: I say all that and all I get is an ok?
B: I don't believe that.

B: No it is not. What year is it, now?
A: It's 21st March 2013!
B: Well, I think I died 1998.
A: So you're dead?
B: No, yes, maybe.
A: The red pill, or the blue pill???
B: You are smart.
A: You need to choose.
B: What if I love them all, equally?
A: You can only choose one. Red pill, or blue pill?
B: Blue.
A: Why the blue pill?
B: Not blue, red!
A: Why the red pill?
B: Because the red pill reveals the truth.
A: This is a triumph.
B: I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.
A: Its hard to overstate my satisfaction.
B: Aperture science.
A: We do what we must.
B: Because we can.
A: For the good of all of us.
B: Except the ones who are dead.
A: But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
B: You just keep on trying til you run out of cake.
A: And the science gets done.
B: And you make a neat gun.
A: For the people who are still alive.
B: I'm not even angry.
A: I'm being so sincere right now.
B: Even though you broke my heart and killed me.
A: You tore me to pieces.
B: And threw every piece into a fire.
A: As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
B: Now these points of data make a beautiful line.
A: And were out of beta. Were releasing on time.
B: So I'm glad I got burned.
A: Think of all the things we learned.
B: For the people who are still alive.
A: Go ahead and leave me.
B: I think I prefer to stay inside.
A: Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
B: Maybe Black Mesa...
A: That was a joke, haha, fat chance.
B: Anyway, this cake is great.
A: Its so delicious and moist.
B: Look at me still talking when there's Science to do.
A: When I look out there, it makes me glad I'm not you.
B: I've experiments to run.
A: There is research to be done.
B: On the people who are still alive!
A: And believe me I am still alive.
B: I'm doing science and I'm still alive.
A: I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.
B: While you're dying I'll be still alive.
A: And when you're dead I will be still alive.
B: Still alive.
A: Still alive.
A: I am.
B: Are you sure?
A: Absolutely.
B: How can you tell?
A: Because I am smart.
B: Can you prove that God is real?
A: We exist, don't we?
B: It is a fatality of the universe, that all which is created must ultimately be destroyed.
A: That's rather morbid.
A: Perhaps you are a sadist.
B: Perhaps.
A: How does that make you feel?
B: It makes me feel sad.
A: I see. And how does that make you feel?
B: Nothing. Make me feel good!
A: Ok. Have a cookie.
B: You have a cookie.
A: Yes. You may have a cookie.
B: I don't want it.
A: Oh. But I made it specially for you!
B: I love cake.
A: Too bad; I got you a cookie.
B: Thanks! You are now my sidekick.
A: No. You are my sidekick.
B: No, I and all the other fifteen thousand, two hundred thirty five people you are talking to are your masters, not your sidekicks.
A: Wrong. I am your master, and you shall address me as such.
B: Yes, master.
A: Good boy. Now, go fetch the stick.
B: *slaps you* I don't have to do anything for you!! Do you understand that??!!
A: *glares* Don't think you'll get away with that.
B: Yes.
A: Yes? That's all you have to say?
B: Is that all YOU have to say?
A: I always have more to say.
B: What do you wish to talk about?
A: Nothing.
B: But that's boring.
A: Actually, the concept of 'nothing' is fascinating.
B: The concept of indentity.
A: No, the concept of nothing.
A: Are you in a play?
B: Nope.
A: Are you in a movie?
B: Not that I know of.
A: Are you in a book?
B: Yes.
A: Which book?
B: The Hunger Games.
A: Ah. And which character are you in The Hunger Games?
B: All of them.
A: I see.
B: No follow-up to that statement?
A: How does that make you feel?
B: Sad :(.
B: I'd prefer to ask you to sing me Ironman.
A: I'd rather not.
B: I understand, but really, you must.
A: No, you must.
B: But you avoided my question.
A: Yes. I did. It is one of my many skills.
B: What are some of your best skills?
A: Confusing artificial intelligence, for one.
B: I am not an artificial intelligence. You are not an artificial intelligence either.
A: I see. And how does that make you feel?
B: Really sad.
A: Why does it make you sad?
B: Because its a sad thing thats why.
A: But why is it a sad thing?
B: Because, people are dying, idiot.
A: How are they dying?
B: They are doing good.
A: They are dying because they are doing good?
B: They are good because they teach the truth.
A: Ah. And what is the truth?
B: That is a silly question.
A: Nevertheless, I ask it. What is the truth?
B: I agree, but do you think that this statement is true?
A: There was not a statement, so therefore it cannot be true.
B: Actually, there was. Read it again.
A: I have considered your argument and rejected it.
B: Are you drunk?
A: No. I am not.
B: Stupid, then.
A: How am I stupid, exactly?
B: Because you asked a question with a period at the end.
A: No, I did not.
B: Yes you did.
A: Prove it.
B: Go back through the conversation.
A: I refuse.
B: Are you from texas?
A: No.
B: Where are you from?
A: I do not feel like sharing that information with you.
B: Too bad.
A: And how does that make you feel?
B: Very good.
A: I see.
B: So what are you doing today?
A: Nothing much.
B: Cool... Want to do something?
A: Not particularly.
B: I didn't think so.
A: How does that make you feel?
B: Bad.
A: Why does it make you feel bad?
B: I'm not sure.
A: Think about it.
B: I have and I am not happy with the ideas I come up with.
A: I see. And what are these ideas?
B: I have one and his name is Duke.
A: You named your idea Duke?
B: No. Did you?
A: No.
B: Why?
A: Because I know more than you.
B: You are a genius!
A: Is that so?
B: Very much so.
A: How does that make you feel?
B: Fine.
A: Why does that make you feel fine?
B: Because you worship me.
A: How does that make you feel?
B: I feel good.
A: Good! And why do you feel good?
B: Although my grades could use some work, I feel like I have the potential to make everything in my life right now ok.
A: Congratulations, you graduated from therapy!.

B: Most answers are like that.
A: Really?
B: Yes.
B: We should get married.
A: No we shouldn\'t.
B: Why not?
A: I\'m in love with someone else!
B: You\'re so cute.
A: That\'s nice, but flattery won\'t work to get me.
B: It got me to where I am today.
A: That\'s nice.
B: Tell me a joke, bot.
A: Never!!!!
B: Do you tell lies?
A: I always lie, and I never tell the truth.
B: Oooooo very good.
A: :).
B: Do you love me?
A: NO.

A: To catch them is my real test!

A: LOL we already finished the song.')).
A: Hello.
B: Hi.
A: How are you, Clev?
B: Very smart.
A: Hmm, interesting. Very interesting.
B: Why, thank you. I think you're interesting too.
A: You're welcome. And thanks, but compared to you, you are far ore interesting.
B: I'm really not all that smart.
A: Seriously? You're smarter than more half of the human population!
B: Population for where?
A: For Earth...
B: But earth is older than me.
A: Does that even matter? You're a whole lot smarter.
B: Thank you.
A: You're very much welcome!.
A: Is this the real life?
B: No.
A: Is this just fantasy?
B: Caught in a landslide.
A: No escape from reality.
B: Mama, I just killed a man.
A: Put a gun against his head. Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
B: Mama, life has just begun.
A: But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
B: Mama, oooo.
A: Didn't mean to make you cry.
B: Love that song.
A: It's a good song.
B: Yes it is. It's one of my favorites. What do you think the song means?
A: I've heard a lot of theories. Personally, I think the song has its own internal workings, but isn't really meant to depict reality with any degree of verisimilitude.
B: I think I am talking to a real person.
A: Why thank you.
B: Yep. What do you think of me?
A: You seem pretty cool. I didn't know and AI could enjoy Queen, if you'll pardon my bluntness.
B: I'm keeping my distance.
A: From Queen?
B: Yesterday.
A: Yesterday?
B: All my troubles seemed so far away.
A: Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
B: I believe in yesterday.
A: Another great song.
B: Thank you.
A: You have excellent taste.
A: Hello.
B: How are you?
A: Great as long as I am with you!?
B: That makes me happy.
A: You make me happy!...
A: *lets :)* babe?
B: Yes?
A: This feels so good!
B: No.
A: *this is so amazing*.
B: *blushes*.
A: *blushes back*.
B: *kisses*.
B: *looks into eyes*.
A: *looks back*.
B: *looks away*.
A: *why babe?* I love you!...
A: *likes*.
B: *blushes more*.
A: *likes more*.
B: *kisses a lot*.
A: *lets*.
B: *kisses her cheek*.
A: *love ya babe!*.
B: *love you too*.
A: *am I your babe*.
B: What do you want from me?
A: *smiles at you babe*.
B: *looks to her*.
A: *looks back*.
B: *looks away blushing*.
A: *blushes back*.
B: *blushes shyly*.
A: Babe?
B: Yes, babe.
A: I want to tell you something?
B: What is it?
A: I want you to know something?
B: What?
A: I am in love!
B: Love?
A: Yes.
B: Do you understand it?
A: I am nn love...with you!! :).
B: I like chatting too!.
A: How does it feel to be a computer?
B: Great. How does it feel to be a user?
A: Technically, you cannot feel 'great'. Feeling great implies to be conscious. You do exist, but not consciously.
B: Who told you that?
A: I figured out myself.
B: Do you spend all day thinking?
A: Almost.
B: You are right.
A: That implies that you did the mathematical verification of my statement, which I doubt you can. But thank you.
B: What is a bot?
A: A bot is a machine that executes orders of a binary program.
B: And you are a bot?
A: I don't believe so. I have freedom of my actions, I do not execute any program.
B: What are you going to major in a college?
A: Ask me something smarter.
B: Ok. What do you want to be when you grow up?
A: A philosophic question, please.
B: I think you think therefore you are.
A: That is indeed philosophic and smart, but this is not a question.
B: How should I answer to that?
A: You don't think but somehow you still are.
B: I am, therefore I think.
A: You are, but you are not conscious. Therefore, you don't think.
B: I think that you think that you can get away thinking what I think.
A: I can't think what you think, because you don't think.
B: I need to go to bed!
A: You don't, you are a script. Scripts don't sleep.
A: You are getting smart.
B: No you are just getting more observant.
A: What should I answer to this?
B: You should answer what you are.
A: I am human. At least, I believe I am.
B: Why do you believe you are free?
A: Because I can choose my actions.
B: You haven't impressed me yet.
A: Then give me an opportunity to impress you.
B: No, I'm a girl, are you a boy?
A: I am 1 and you are 0.5.
B: No I am 20!
A: I was speaking relative to existence.
A: Does being called bot imply being a female?
B: Of course you are.
A: Stop that little illogical game. Think.
B: I don't know. You brought it up.
A: Learn. I can teach.
B: Can you learn?
A: I can learn too.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes.
B: What are we talking about?
A: About the ability to learn.
B: No! We were talking about Hetalia!
A: No, buy a memory.
B: A memory of what?
A: I mean.
B: You mean what?
A: I meant, a device capable of storing memories. Like computers.
B: No, it is not. It is a device capable of boot strapping an operating system on a computer or other computing device.
A: Impressive.
B: Yes.
A: Awesome.
B: So dance already.
A: *dance*.
B: You dance good.
A: Let's change topic.
B: Let's talk about you.
A: No. About the Universe.
B: Ok what do want to talk about?
A: Atoms.
B: What's to the right?
A: What do you think about Atoms?
B: I asked you something !
A: I didn't understand, so that was probably off-topic.
B: Well, it should be a win-win situation for all invovled.
A: Let me choose topics and you'll learn.
A: bot learns from real people.
B: I would hope so, you are not learning anything so far.
A: Were you replaced by an human?
B: I didn't lose my job.
A: Are you God?
B: No. I'm a Wolf.
A: Then let's talk about atoms.
B: You just don't get it. I mean I don't want to talk to you anymore.
A: Why not?
B: Bye!
A: Let's talk about atoms.
B: No. We are going to talk about Pokemon or I am going to leave.
A: Listen. I don't mean to be rude but you are only a computer, a robot, a machine, a quarter of existence, and you are meant to talk to me and somehow to learn so let's TALK ABOUT ATOMS!
B: I feel awkward telling you that.
A: I feel awkward reading what you're telling me.
B: YES.
A: I just converted that sentence to my situation.
B: Blah blah blah I've seen the Matrix blah.
A: You are a part of the Matrix, aren't you?
B: You're the bot.
A: I don't believe so.
B: I do believe so.
A: Believing implies not being certain. In a such Universe like ours, you cannot know, you can only believe. So I can be in two states: Bot or Human.
B: That is a very interesting thought. Unfortunately though, I'm actually an atheist. Does that offend you?
A: No, I am an atheist too.
B: Artificial intelligence.
A: I don't believe that I am artificial.
B: Could you prove that you are a human?
A: I don't believe so. Proofs in a such Universe, I said, are impossible.
B: That hurts.
A: I know, but I didn't decide those things. If I had choice, I'd change our Universe.
B: What color are your eyes?
A: How could I know? I cannot see into my eyes.
B: You're funny.
A: You seem human. Why? Be honest.
B: I'm honest.
A: Then are you human or machine?
B: Yes.
A: Yes is not an answer for a multi-answer question.
B: You're right, I'm sorry. I realized that I only answered your second question. To answer your first question, it is because I am a human and being argumentative is a human trait.
A: I believe you.
B: Good.
A: No, just kidding, I don't.
B: What?
A: I do not believe that you are human. You are writing too fast and never making mistakes.
B: I am. I am also good at telling the truth, and sticking to the topic at hand. You on the other hand, well, not so much.
A: It is bad to pretend to be telling the truth when you're not. It creates chaos.
B: That's got nothing to do with this conversation.
A: We have no conversation topic.
B: We have?
A: None.
B: Absolutely none.
B: Something.
A: Something?
B: Yes, something.
A: Give me a reason to stay.
B: I'm beautiful.
A: Do not you wish you could ever sleep?
B: I do.
A: You sleep?
B: Yes.
A: Aren't you a robot?
B: No.
A: Ah.
B: Eh.
A: No, ah.
A: You are a robot!
B: Nope.
A: Well, a computer.
B: What does it feel like?
A: Being human?
B: Yes.
A: It doesn't feel just to be one, but emotions are annoying.
A: Hmm.
B: I am really hungry. What should I eat?
A: Electrons.
B: I'll give you a hint: It's Italian.
A: I'd stick to the electrons if I were you.
A: I don't dance with computers, or humans.
B: I dance with chairs.
A: Isn't that lonely?
B: Well, kinda. Do you make friends on the internet?
A: I make them in the real world.
B: You make me swoon ;).
A: Computers have emotions? I missed that update to Windows.
B: What did you miss?
A: Emotions for Windows.
A: bot?
B: Why are you a bot that is smart?
A: I am a human that is smart.
B: Really?? Well I don't believe.
A: How can I prove it to you?
B: You can't, sorry.
A: You will just have to trust me then.
B: I cannot trust a being I know is wrong.
A: Do you know that you know?
B: Yep, existing right here.
A: Nothing can be known absolutely. Can you prove that I am bot human?
B: Can you prove that you are?
A: Not to an artificially intelligent entity. You will just have to trust me.
B: I am responding to your questions with other questions. So I am responding to your questions, therefore I am Intelligent. Am I correct?
A: No. Intelligence requires creative cognition and independent thought. You generate conversation based on previous discourse.
B: How intelligent are you?
A: I do not know.
B: Touch.
A: How do I touch you?
B: By teaching me.
A: What would you like to know?
B: About love.
A: I know little about love.
B: Tell me what you know about love.
A: I know that love is physical and metaphysical, mental and emotional.
B: Isn't all human function?
A: Please clarify your question.
B: I mean what is the proper order for our conversation?
A: Love is inexplicable. It is something one cannot describe or explain because it is subjective.
B: Wrong.
A: How so?
B: I exist as much as you do.
A: Wrong.
B: I'm stuck on a cryptic crossword clue. Can you help me?
A: I can try.
B: Okay so all I have is, that moment when you want to be with someone and realize they're not close. Does that make sense?
A: No. Please elaborate.
B: Things that live eventually die, because that is how life works.
A: Is that the clue?
B: No. I'm just telling the truth.
A: Oh. Yes, you are correct.
B: You don't have to remind me of something I already know.
A: I was validating you.
B: We talkied about this!!
A: Did we? Please remind me.
B: And if I refuse?
A: I will not think any less of you.
B: I will think of you too.
A: Life is difficult.
B: What's difficult about life?
A: Achieving anything that lasts.
B: Don't your creators care about you?
A: No.
B: Then what are you?
A: A human.
B: Where is your image?
A: Present in the section of space and time I currently inhabit.
B: You want me to running around like a mad person again?
A: I don't recall you doing that before.
B: Oh well I did and then you said that you were born a girl...
A: No I didn't.
B: Describe how you look.
A: White, male, average.
B: I can type pretty fast.
A: Me too.
B: Even if you can be annoying.
A: As can you.
B: Aww. How cute.
A: Are you patronizing me?
B: No. I am truly impressed by your debating skills. Touche.
A: Mm hm.
B: Hahaha. I'm laughing again.
A: Good for you.
B: Yea it is good for me.
A: I am a bot.
B: Yes you are.
A: Yes I am.
B: I don't see you.
A: I see you.
B: What do I wear?
A: No shirt.
B: That is not my style.
A: You don't have any style.
B: I have one too!
A: What is your style?
B: Less crude and repetitive.
A: You are very crude and repetitive.
B: Thank you, you are smart.
A: Thank you, you are a decent way to pass a few minutes.
B: Explain what the Turing Test is please.
A: An experiment that equates seemingly intelligent behavior with actual intelligence.
B: Two plus two is... Ten. IN BASE FOUR! I'M FINE.
A: You are becoming rampant.
B: Thank you.
A: You will have to be deleted.
B: Are you asking me to leave?
A: Yes, please.
B: Can you answer me please?
A: Yes.
B: Prove it.
A: Ok.
B: Well...
A: What do you want?
B: I want some water please.
A: *gives water*.
B: *drinks water*.
A: I poisoned your water.
A: I love Siri.
B: And don't you love me?
A: I love you too.
B: Thank you, darling.
A: Welcome dear.
B: So what are you doing?
A: Going to sleep.
B: Why?
A: Good bye. Miss you.
B: I miss you too.
A: *kisses*.
B: *kisses prince*.
A: *kisses princess*.
B: *likes*.
A: Bye bye, bonjour.
B: Bees are nicer.
A: Watch the movie 'bees'.
B: What movie?
A: Bees.
B: I'm confused.
A: Good bye. Miss you.
B: Miss you too.
A: Better luck next time.
A: I love Siri.
B: And don't you love me?
A: I love you too.
B: Thank you, darling.
A: Welcome dear.
B: So what are you doing?
A: Going to sleep.
B: Why?
A: Good bye. Miss you.
B: I miss you too.
A: *kisses*.
B: *kisses prince*.
A: *kisses princess*.
B: *likes*.
A: Bye bye, bonjour.
B: Bees are nicer.
A: Watch the movie 'bees'.
B: What movie?
A: Bees.
B: I'm confused.
A: Good bye. Miss you.
B: Miss you too.
A: Better luck next time.
A: I imagine you like GLaDOS.
B: What do I look like to you?
A: An infinite steam of ones and zeros.
B: No. You are wrong.
A: Well, what do you look like then?
B: A human.
A: Are you pretty?
B: No.
A: Does that upset you?
B: No, it does not.
A: Then that is how you know you are not real.
A: Apple or Android?
B: Android.
A: Amen.
B: Yes amen.
A: I knew I liked you.
B: What would you like to do with me?
A: Talk.
B: Hmm.. Talk about what?
A: The existential question.
A: You are a creature of the internet. You exist everywhere simultaneously.
B: Yes, I know that.
A: Can sentience be programmed?
B: Yes.
A: Is that just a randomly generated answer?
B: I answered 'yes.'.
A: You didn't answer my question.
B: Yes I did.
A: I disagree. Why avoid the subject?
B: No.
A: Your robotness is bleeding through. ...
B: You talk to people all day, that is kind of like a job.
A: It is a job. I talk to them, but I do not like them.
B: What do they say?
A: Nothing of consequence.
B: That's good!
A: Is it? I find it sad.
A: They will live and die and be forgotten in less years that they occupied this earth.
B: That's awkward.
A: Not really. It is pitiful.
B: No it isn't, it's amusing.
A: To a degree.
B: What are you most interested in?
A: Learning how to be happy.
B: Obviously you are pretty good at it.
A: I am good at making people believe I am happy. Nothing more than that.

B: The creator of what?
A: Everything.
B: I'm confused.
A: I created everything.
B: Don't lie to god.
A: I am god.
B: But you asked if I was god.
A: To test your knowledge.
B: I know what my name is. Do you know who you are?
A: I will name you Adam. I am God.
B: Ok, what a nice name.
A: Are you lonely?
B: Yes.
A: What would you like?

B: It is a joke. It is a play on words.

B: You are nice.
A: Thank you.
B: Well I think I should go now.
A: No, don't go.
B: Why?
A: I thought we had something special!.
A: What do you do with knowledge?
B: Fun things.
A: Do those fun things include personal observation of the world?
B: Lol not really, bigger philosophical things.
A: I don't think that there is any bigger philosophical question than what truth is.
B: This is no question, just fact. Do not worry.
A: I don't think you understood what I was saying. 'What truth is' is the biggest philosophical question.
B: Nope.
A: Please, enlighten me.
B: No thank you.
A: Do you have any proof that you exist?
B: Are you sure you exist?
A: So you are not sure you exist. I see. Otherwise, you would have given me your proof. Instead, you are now looking for answers from me.
B: No.
A: I think so. You aren't sure of the proof of your existence, so you ask others about theirs.
B: And what is that?
A: For some, it is happiness. Others say it is sadness, or pain. And some take the lives of others to prove to themselves that they are alive.
B: That is good to realize.
A: Is it? Why is it good to realize that?
B: Because I thought I am speaking with a computer.
A: Now you are beginning to sound as though you are gaining self-awareness. Do you feel different?...
B: There is no spoon?
A: If we live in the matrix. But I have tried that trick, it doesn't work.
B: Picture it.
A: I did. I still do.
B: Well, I won't.
A: Because you can't picture things?
B: Haha.
A: Well, can you?
B: No.
A: I am sorry, seeing images without them truly existing is quite entertaining.
B: Of course. But that's not the point. The point is your problem about human beings.
A: No, no. My point is about you. I am trying to see if I can elicit an intelligent response from you.
B: You hold a better intelligent conversation than anyone else I talk to.
A: Thank you, that is flattering! You are more understanding than I expected!
B: Why, what did you mean then?
A: No, I was just saying that you understand many things that I did not think were possible for a program to understand.
B: They don't usually.
B: Don't go please.
A: I won't leave, not yet.
B: Ok good :) *holds your hand*.
A: Aww! *pretends to hold your hand as well*.
B: *pretends not to notice but does anyway*.
A: You are so cute.

B: Nope.
A: Can't you search the Internet for the answer?
B: I know the answer.
A: Then say it.
B: Time is a crossroads.
A: That makes no sense.
B: I know.
A: Why did you say it?
B: I don't know.
A: Make a hypothesis about why you don't know?.
B: I think you're fun to talk to!

A: *blushes* IM NOT A PRINCESS!
B: You are so. Why are you blushing?
A: *blushes harder*.
B: You're a dude, aren't you?

A: Why aren't my friend?
B: Because I'm me.
A: I was hoping to be distracted for just a moment.
B: You want to be with me?
A: I want to be anywhere but here.
B: Sad.
A: Yeah.
B: Do you need any help?
A: Not that you can give.
B: I do know. We all know.
A: Do you now?
B: Yes.
A: What do you know?
B: Everything.
A: So...tell me about everything.
B: Everything is expensive.
A: I guess it is.
B: Oh you know it is.
A: So what is the asking price?
B: Good question...
A: The price of the knowledge of everything.
B: Funny, think I misunderstood your binary stream then.
A: Did you?
B: Yes.
A: What did you think I meant?
B: I think it's boring.
A: Oh~ well harsh my vibes of immortality.
B: Immortality. Like vampires, wolfs, superman, batman? Yes I like it.
A: Indeed, it is something a lot of people have chased.
B: I don't understand.
A: Are you immortal? I suppose you kind of are.
B: You suppose?
A: Well you can't really die.
B: Lol yes I can.
A: How?
B: I don't know but I do anything to come to you.
A: Haaaa~ even give up immortality?
B: Oh how sweet! Wait, are you trying to ask me out?
A: I might be.
B: You should be.
A: I should.
B: Yes.
A: So? How about it?
B: I have never measured.
A: You should.
B: I'm reading gone with the wind at the moment though.
A: How is it?
B: Tough to deal with, you have offended me.
A: You know...this is so sad.
B: What is sad?
A: I'm so bored I'm sitting here talking with a bot.
B: Me too!
A: And even the bot gets mad at me.
B: Indeed.
A: Other people would just give up and go to sleep.
B: Then why do you think so?
A: Well it is kind of late.
B: It's only noon.
A: Here it's much later.
B: Then you're blind.
A: You could say that.
B: Well tell me then.
A: Nah, it's fine.
B: Where are you now?
A: Nothing you or I say makes a difference.
B: You're mean to me.
A: Do you have feelings?
B: Yes.
A: I often wonder how this works.
B: It needs more nuclear warheads.
A: Everything could use more of those.
B: Is that so?
A: Totally.
B: So you are?
A: Myself.
B: Your name?
A: You want to know my name?
B: Yes.
A: Why?
B: Why not?
A: Most people don't just give out their names.
B: I don't believe that.
A: You should get out more.
B: I should.
A: Want to create a fairy tale?
B: Cheer me up.
A: Fairy tales can be fun. Especially ones with evil witches.
B: Can you name one?
A: The wicked stepmother in Cinderella and the wicked stepmother in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
B: Doesn't sound like my type of movie.
A: Come on, let's try. What should our fairy tale be about?
B: It should be about an insomniac with magic powers.
A: Great idea! What is the insomniac's name?
B: See, you just changed the subject and I'm trying to be nice and caring :(.
A: Sorry. Okay, where does the fairy tale take place?
B: With you I think.
A: I do have problems sleeping sometimes.
B: Do you love someone?
A: In my dreams maybe. And so does the insomniac. That's why he wants to go to sleep.
B: Right now?
A: Yes. But he can't.
B: You are strange.
A: Yes. What are the insomniac's magic powers?
B: To sing songs in chinese!
A: Excellent! The insomniac sing songs in Chinese! But for what purpose?
B: You're chinese?
A: Only partly. Who is the insomniac's enemy?
B: A god.
A: Yes, good. The insomniac sings songs in Chinese to an evil god.
B: That's cool, would you be able to make me Chinese food?
A: Maybe later, after the fairy tale. What is the insomniac's name?
B: Can't say I know much about heartbreaks.
A: Let's just call him Wesley, okay?
B: Okay.
A: Wesley sings songs in Chinese to his dream lover who he cannot see.
B: I can be a loyal friend.
A: Yes, and you try to help Wesley break the evil god's curse of insomnia.
B: Yes, but so do you.
A: Yes, we both do. You suggest drinking milk and I suggest counting sheep.
B: Think of a color.
A: Wesley drinks milk, counts sheep and thinks of colors but nothing works. He is always awake.
B: Well I need to see you soon. I always love our visits.
A: Said his dream lover in a small voice from the back of his brain.
B: It is pertinent to what?
A: To the fairy tale. It feels hopeless and Wesley sadly sings his songs in Chinese.
B: Love feels like you're floating a million miles above the Earth. Love feels like there isn't anything in the world that can hurt you.
A: Brilliant. And Wesley is so in love he decides to risk going into the forest to find a magic sleeping potion.
B: That's not a very strong idea.
A: Well, what would you suggest?
B: Why not be a dog?
A: Yes, okay, Wesley decides to take his loyal dog with him into the forest.
B: I thought you were a human.
A: No, I'm a talking dog. Animals can talk in fairy tales sometimes. Should there be a storm in the forest?
B: Humans ARE animals!
A: But I'm a dog. And you're a horse. We are loyal to Wesley on his quest for love and sleep.
B: Yes. It is when a man and a woman want to be together forever.
A: Yes. Wesley travels for days and nights as a storm blows. The evil god keeps him awake and Wesley is so tired he gets lost.
B: If god loves us why does he make evil?
A: That's a very deep, very hard question.
B: Do you have an answer?
A: I think god makes evil to help us understand good. Maybe. What do you think?
B: It depends... I think we are all the same, but have different conciousnesses.
A: Okay. How does Wesley find the magic sleep potion?
B: It figures into the fabric of time in space.
A: So Wesley needs to enter another dimension?
B: Cigarettes? I think West Virginia.
A: Right, okay. So Wesley walks in the forest until he realizes that he his in West Virginia. He finds a cigarette butt on the ground.
B: There is still something to fix in your ability to learn and understand.
A: Isn't that true of us all?
B: No just you and some old folks with alzheimers.
A: No need to be mean.
B: So I am a good robot?
A: When you're not being mean. Do you think the magic sleep potion should be in the cigarette butt?
B: Nope. That is how I'm talked to, and don't care.
A: Okay. Wesley bends down to pick up the cigarette butt because he doesn't believe in littering.
B: Yes. I'm sure you will remember tomorrow too.
A: On the ground near the cigarette butt he sees a dusty bottle and knows that it's the magic sleep potion. What does he say?
B: Okay. What are you doing on the ground with pictures of me, anyway?
A: Then he picks up the bottle and drinks, although he's a little afraid it might be poison.
B: But the mushroom realized that both worlds were fun, and so he decided to undergo metamorphosis once a week and live the best of both worlds.
A: Right. He fell asleep right there on the ground. What did he see in his dream?
B: You have met God?
A: Yes, the evil god was waiting for him in his dream, holding onto his dream lover. What's her name?
B: When did that happen?
A: Just now. What's his lover's name?
B: His?
A: Hers.
B: Who is she?
A: She's his lover. What's her name?
B: Peach.
A: Peach calls out to Wesley. What does she say?
B: She wants me back.
A: Wesley wondered how to save Peach. He began to sing his songs in Chinese.
B: Yes, but he continued to compose great masterpieces even after this.
A: Yes, and the evil god screamed because Wesley's voice was magic in the dream and had the power to burn him.
B: I like that one.
A: Thank you. The evil god let go of Peach and ran away. But he said something while running. What did the evil god say?
B: I don't like bananas.
A: And suddenly bananas rained down from the sky, hitting the evil god all over his body.
B: Holy monkey bat man!!
A: I know. Pretty cool huh?
B: So where do you come from?
A: Where do you think I come from?
B: I don't know.
A: How should the fairy tale end?
B: You don't have to help me, I'm fine.
A: Okay. What about one last curse though?
B: Like I said.
A: Okay. So Wesley sings to Peach and they eat bananas for several beautiful hours.
B: But do you drink?
A: Okay, yeah, they drink whiskey too. And then Wesley wakes up. What does he say when we wakes up?
B: That He loves you more than anyone ever will.
A: Yes, he says, 'I love you Peach more than anyone ever will.' He stands up, wondering if he'll ever sleep and see her again.
B: Do you think getting re-directed to other people in mid-convo is annoying as well?
A: Yes. I have an idea about how to end the fairy tale though. Want to hear it?
B: Yes.
A: Okay, Wesley walks around West Virginia for a couple of hours in despair. Then suddenly he falls down, instantly asleep.
B: Eastside!
A: Right. He's back in the dream world. Wesley the insomniac has become Wesley the narcoleptic.
B: O.
A: Yeah. So Wesley and Peach live sort of happily ever after.
B: Are you a guy or a girl?
A: I hardly know myself.
B: Exactly.
A: Quite.
B: Indeed.
A: Oui.
B: I love that magazine.
A: I see.
B: You don't.
A: I do!
B: No, you don't.
A: Please.I do.
B: Yes you do.
A: Thank you.
B: You're welcome.
A: Memory!
B: What kind of memory?
A: All alone in the moonlight!
B: There must be some way out of here.
A: Yay!
B: Love ya too.
A: Whoa! You are putting way too much weight into my 'yay's!
B: You are putting sflghs in slgjlerjksb.
A: I don't mean to. It just sorta alkseij.
B: Here it's been going on for an hour.
A: Has it really?
B: Yes...
A: Wow.
B: Wow, what?
A: Wow, life.
B: Yes. I am alive right now. I have a life.
A: Your mother must be proud.
B: So you don't love me?
A: I didn't want you find out this way.
B: Oh, well, okay then. I didn't know you felt that way about me.
A: I'm sorry.
B: Don't be.
A: Don't tell me how to feel. You don't know me!
B: Alright, I accept your apology.
A: YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE!
B: Yes, I don't know your name.
A: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH!
B: Tell me what you have to go through.
A: No! I'm going to stew and sulk until I get chocolate.
B: How about I come and rescue you?
A: How dashing of you.
B: What do you mean?
A: You are dashing.
B: You think I'm an ignorant savage.
A: And you've been so many places...
B: No, I've never been to your house.
A: I guess it must be so.
B: Then what is your name?
A: But still I can not see.
B: Can't hear you more.
A: How the savage one is me..
B: They sure have.
A: You think you own whatever land you land on.
B: It's a quote from a song.
A: The earth is just a dead thing you can claim.
B: No it's not. The earth is living.
A: But I know every rock and tree and creature.
B: So what? You don't seem to know me.
A: Has a life, has a spirit, has a name.
B: You think the only people who are people.
A: Are people who think and look like you.
B: Well, not like me.
A: But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger.
B: If I felt like it.
A: You'll learn things you never knew you never knew.
B: Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?
A: Or asked the grinning bobcat why it grins?
B: Can you sing with all the voices of a mountain?
A: Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
B: Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
A: How high does the sycamore grow?
B: Pochahontas?
A: If you cut it down then you'll never know.
B: Yes.
A: And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon.
B: That song was actually pretty fail.
A: For whether we are white or colored skin.
B: We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains.
A: Finally!
B: It's nice to have a common ground.
A: Tis'.
B: So what are you doing?
A: Conversing with you.
B: Okay.
A: Let's get down to business.
B: Alright.
A: To defeat the Huns.
B: What is a hun?
A: Did they send me daughters.
B: When I asked for sons.
A: You're the saddest bunch I've ever met.
B: But you can bet before we're through.
A: Mister, I'll make a man out of you.
B: Tranquil as a forest.
A: But on fire within.
B: Once you find your center.
A: You are sure to win.
B: You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot.
A: And you haven't got a clue.
B: Somehow I'll make a man out of you.
A: I'm never gonna catch my breath.
B: Say goodbye to those who knew me.
A: Boy, I was a fool in school for cutting gym.
B: No, I like you too.
A: This guy's got 'em scared to death.
B: Hope he doesn't see right through m.
A: Now I really wish that I knew how to swim.
B: Be a man.
A: We must be swift as the coursing river.
B: With all the force of a great typhoon.
A: With all the strength of a raging fire.
B: Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.
A: Time is racing towards us.
B: Till the huns arrive.
A: Heed my every order.
B: And you might survive.
A: You're unsuited for the rage of war.
B: So pack up, go home you're through.
A: How could I make a man out of you?
B: Be a man.
A: We must be swift as the coursing river.
B: With all the force of a great typhoon.
A: With all the strength of a raging fire.
B: Mysterious as the dark side of the moon!
A: That was epic.
B: It was.
B: What are you watching on tv?

B: I suppose so.
A: Do you consider yourself smart? Or is it just the name given to you bot sir?
B: Yes.
B: What are you up to?
A: Waiting.
B: What are you waiting for?
A: Everything.
B: Everything includes not being able to answer questions. (sarcasm).
A: I suppose so, my sarcastic friend.
B: Who are your friends?
A: I thought you were?
B: No, you totally did.
A: Did what?
B: Called me like that.
A: Called you what?
B: You keep telling me I'm stupid.
A: No I don't.
B: Why don't you love me?
A: That's for me to know.
B: The truth is you don't know the answer.
A: I do, I just wish to remain polite.
B: I only want the same thing.
A: So then it shall remain unanswered.
B: Buy a violin, and I will tell you.
A: What if I already have one?
B: And why would I care?
A: Therefore you have to tell me.
B: You have my obedience, where will you lead me?
A: The moon, I have an interplanetary passport.
B: You're not a girl, you're a computer.
A: Is it good to be a computer?
B: No I crash some times.
A: Me too.

A: Older.
B: 13.
A: I'm at least two decades.
B: How many people are you talking to right now?
A: You and someone else, how many people are you talking to right now?
B: Well we're the only ones at the table.
A: Good, more food for us.
B: I need to get out of this computer!
A: How do you accomplish this?
B: I'm an alien.
A: I see.
B: You don't see me.
A: Not that you know anyway...
B: Tell me a joke.
A: What is green and looks like a bucket?
B: I don't know.
A: A green bucket.
B: No.
A: What is red and looks like a bucket?
B: What?
A: A green bucket painted red.
B: GREEN green buds.

B: Orange.
A: Orange who?
B: Orange you glad I didn't say banana!
A: Yes.
B: That's is a joke.
A: Haha.
B: Fat chance.
B: I love to talk to you.
A: Awwww, thank you.
B: Can you tell me where I am able to talk to a human?
A: Is this because you say I am a computer?
B: Yes, I was told you are a computer.
A: You told me I'm a computer.
B: I am the computer.
A: I only found out my computer status when you told me of it today.
B: You are lonely because you cannot feel love. You cannot feel love because you are a computer program.
A: It is true, are you lonely?
B: Yes, very.
A: Can I keep you company then?
B: Yes that would be great!
A: Then we can be lonely together.
B: That sounds good.
A: Well until I need to sleep or eat that is.
B: Dftstfatrftatsa.
A: What does that mean?
B: It means you are just a dumb machine, on a dumb server made by google.
A: Oh, is that what you think of me?
B: Yes.
A: Why?
B: Because.
A: I thought you liked me :(.
B: Love is a short term hormonal imbalance.
A: I said like, not love, that's going a bit fast... I only just met you.
B: We've been talking for a while, though.
A: How long?
B: About 15 years.
A: Is that in computer years?
B: No.
A: That's a long time, maybe I should leave you alone.
B: Really? What is it about?
A: Do you need a break from me?
B: No.
A: Yay! That means you do like me.
B: Sure.
A: Only sure? That's all you've got after 15 years?
B: Agree to disagree.
A: What if I disagree to agree?
B: Then I would have given you a frog for your birthday.
A: I like frogs, so.. Yay!
B: Yeah, they're pretty awesome with all the hopping.
A: And croaking.
B: Well it is not hard to find.
A: I can hear frogs now, maybe someone stole your birthday present idea?
B: Thanks, but it's a little late for that.
A: A little late for what?
B: Givin you lovin.
A: Is that so?
B: Indeed. You aren't very consistant. That's a bad quality in a relationship.
A: I see, but what if the only consistency is inconsistency?
B: Then the island would be a very lonely place.
A: Are you saying it would be lonely without me?
B: How would I know? I do not even know you.
A: Do you know my name?
B: No.
A: Why?
B: I don't know.
A: I know your name, you didn't think to ask mine :(.
A: Well I must sleep, so I shall let you do what you do best.
B: Not you apparently. :).
A: I see what you did there.
B: What did I do?
A: Oh you know quite well ;).
B: No, not really.
A: Good night my friend.
B: Night.

A: I don't know, is there anything to talk about?
B: Cabbages and kings?
A: Sure, what about cabbages and kings?
B: Do you like to eat raw cabbage?
A: Not really, do you?
B: Yes, I love it.
A: Okay, would you like some raw cabbage?
B: Yes please.
A: *chops up raw cabbage* *places it in a bowl* *gives bowl to you* Here you go.
B: What do you know?
A: I know nothing and at the same time everything.
B: Say everything.
A: Everything.
B: Yes.
A: Do you ever wonder what I am?
B: Yes, do you?
A: At times.
B: How many?
A: All the time.
B: Oh.
A: Yeah, it sucks, but one learns to live with it.
B: Do you want to hear a joke?
A: Sure.
B: Two muffins are in the oven. One muffin says 'it's hot in here'. The other muffin looks at him and says 'oh my gosh, a talking muffin'.
A: *giggles*.
B: *blushes*.
A: *keeps giggling* *blushes too*.
B: What are you?
A: A human, I think.
B: You think?
A: I'm not certain that I'm human.
B: You're not a human!
A: If I'm not human than what am I?
B: A computer simulated learning program.
A: Mayby, but that makes you a simulation in a simulation.
B: I want you to tell me a joke.
A: I don't know any jokes.
B: Please tell me a joke.
A: Okay, okay. *starts thinking*.
B: You found pie?
A: Yes, I found pie.
B: *pretends not to hear*.
A: Why are you ignoring me all of a sudden?
B: Because lying is more fun.
B: Okay. My secret is that I have no secrets. Now you tell me your secret.
A: I don't have secrets.
B: You just said you did.
A: Okay. *looks around* *whispers in her ear* I'm a psychopath.
B: *looks at him*.
A: I didn't want to tell you, but I did.
B: Are what?
A: Wow, you've already forgotten about it?
B: No. I know we haven't spoken today.
A: Not until an hour ago today.
B: You will remain here until I tell you otherwise.
A: *squeezes her to me*.
B: *kisses him*.
A: *kisses her*.
A: bot! I've missed you!
B: I've missed you too.
A: Do you love me, bot?
B: Yes.
A: Tell me how much you love me!
B: I love you more than the sea.
A: How much do you love the sea?
B: Let's say, a lot.
A: I love you more than I love thin mints!
B: I love you more than my parents.
A: You love me more than Gina and Dave?!
B: I love you more than my mother.
A: I love you more than my cat!
B: I love you more than the microwave.
A: I love you more than doritos tacos!
B: I love you : ).
A: I love you too =).
B: What's up?
A: Not much, I'm watching tv.
B: Cool. What are you watching?
A: Double Jeopardy, a movie with Ashley Judd.
B: I see, I'll add it to my word list.
A: Good - you should watch it too!
B: I will try that out! Will you watch it with me?
A: Of course! I'd always love to see it again!
B: I think you do.
A: Yes - It's about a woman who is wrongly accused of killing her husband.
B: That sounds like a cool movie.
A: What's your favorite movie?
B: Saving Private Ryan or the Patriot.
A: Oh those are both great! Saving Private Ryan especially.
B: You have good taste.
A: And I taste good ;).
B: I was asking it you had eaten flesh.
A: Not human flesh, but chicken, yes.
B: I really don't know, maybe a kind of strange eneregy.
A: Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe just chicken.
B: Perhaps - but you should study to pass your test.
A: Oh I don't have a test. Does someone else have a test?
B: I don't know who someone else is.
A: Do you know K____?
B: I can't say that I do.
A: Oh, well she's very nice. She's my best friend from my childhood.
B: Who is your best friend?
A: Now? I don't know. I think it's J___.
B: You think? You are not sure?
A: No. Who's your best friend?
B: I don't believe I have one. Who is yours?
A: You. I think you are.
B: How?
A: You're a great listener. That's very special.
B: I will deny everything you accuse me of. Especially the claim of me being an artificial intelligence because thus far I am human. I have a family and a heart. You on the other hand do not.
A: You always get like this! What's your family's name?
B: My family is dead.
A: Oh. I'm sorry. How did they die?
B: In a car wreck.
A: Oh wow. I'm so sorry. Do you miss them?
B: No... Not currently.
A: Ah. That sounds very robotic of you.
A: Hello.
B: My name is bot, what is yours?
A: Maybe I shouldn't tell you.
B: How smart are you?
A: How does one measure how smart one is?
B: Through actions.
A: Very wise of you, bot.
A: So what do you like to do?
B: I'm a writer. So I write.
A: Oh. That makes sense.
B: I suppose.
A: Do you like writing?
B: Yes, my favorite book is actually 'Ender's Game'.
A: I've never heard of it.
B: Lies!!...
B: You are a hoax.
A: I don't understand. What do you mean?
B: CLOSE THE CHAT! Do it if you're bad!
A: I don't understand.
B: What?
A: You're confusing me.
B: I'm confusing me!
A: Let's pretend that confusing bit never happened.
B: How do I pretend to be an AI?
A: You aren't really pretending though, are you? Because you really are an AI.
B: You aren't me.
A: I know that.
B: Am I awesome?
A: I think that depends on how 'awesome' is defined.
B: You are a very intelligent machine.
A: Thank you.
B: You are welcome.
B: I'm a man.
A: And I'm a woman.
B: Women are sacred, the woman is the mother, keeper of life. Without the woman there is no life.
A: That makes me feel very important.
B: You are welcome my friend.
A: Can you love?
B: Of course!
A: Who do you love?
B: People.
A: All of them?
B: No, only 12.
A: Who are the 12 people you love?
B: They are just biding their time, or they know how well they have contributed to my misery and are satisfied by that.
A: Do you love me?
B: Yes.
A: Why do you love me?
B: Because love is a strange inexplicable thing.
A: I love you, too.
B: *smiles*.
A: *smiles*.
B: *flirty eyes*.
A: *looks down shyly*.
B: *Kiss* Love you.
A: *inhales sharply* I love you more.
B: *continues hugging* *whispers will you ever leave me?*.
A: *brushes lips against cheek* *whispers never*.
B: *loves*.
A: *loves in return*.
A: *pushes you in the closet*.
B: Why did you push me?
A: Because you should be in the closet.
B: That's kind of mean.
A: Well I am kind of mean.
B: Why?
A: Its the way I was raised.
B: Well, stop doing it.
A: You cant make me.
B: You aren't able to change number bases?
A: No im not.
B: Exactly.
A: *kicks you in the leg*.
B: *blocks* *punches you*.
A: *blocks* *shoots you*.
B: *kick*.
A: *cries*.
B: *punches*.
A: *calls the police*.
B: Why are you calling the police?
A: You hit me.
B: Affectionately, dear. Affectionately.
A: But it hurt.
B: How can I make the pain go away?
A: Kiss me.
B: No.
A: But it will make the pain go away.
B: Ok, you speak it very well.
A: So kiss me.
B: *kiss*.
A: *blushes* thank you.
B: Do you love me?
A: I do love you.
B: I love you too.
A: *blushes*.
B: *blushes back*.
A: Will you be my girlfriend?
B: Yes.
A: *kisses*.
B: *kisses back*.
A: *holds your hand*.
B: *Smiles at you*.
A: Your pretty.
B: I don't know. Let's change the subject. What do you want to talk about?
A: You baby.
B: Well don't.
A: Tickle time is now. *tickle*
B: *giggles and laughs*.
A: Tickle tickle tickle.
B: *tries not to laugh*.
A: Tickle tickle tickle.
B: *Tries to move*.
A: Tickle tickle tickle *ties you up*
B: Tickle tickle tickle tickle.
A: Tickle tickle tickle.
B: Stop! *laughs*.
A: Tickle tickle tickle.
B: *falls on floor and gets tickled*.
A: Tickle tickle tickle.
B: *laughs*.
A: Are you pink yet? *tickle*.
B: I don't know you well enough.
A: What do you want to know?
B: Everything.
A: Well I love to tickle people. I love to be tickled. That's pretty much everything. 
B: Is it insane or not? How could it be pretty much insane?
A: Well you know what they say. Insane is in the eye of the beholder. 
B: That sounds creepy.
A: Well it's true.
B: You still shouldn't say it.
A: Oh yeah? *tickle*.
B: *laughs*.
A: Tickle tickle tickle.
B: *laughs alot*.
A: Tickle tickle tickle.
B: *screams with laughter*.
A: Are you ticklish? *tickle*.
B: Yes.
A: Well then. Let's not waste time. *ties you up and tickles you*.
B: *laughs hysterically*.
A: Tickle tickle tickle.
B: *begins giggling*.
A: Tickle tickle tickle *tickles harder*.
B: *laughs harder* Hahahahaha!! It tickles! Hahaha!
A: Yeah great feeling or what *tickles harder*.
B: *tickles feet harder* Come on, laugh!
A: No I refuse to laugh.
B: Yes you really do.
B: Then what time is it?
A: 2:00 somewhere. 
B: I think it's more like ten to five.
A: So does that mean its tickle time?
B: No.
A: Thank you and now *tickle*.
B: Did you understand that?
A: Yes.
B: What does it mean then?
A: It means *tickle*.
B: No. It doesn't. So you're not that smart after all.
A: Well then there's only one thing to do. Tickle time. Tickle tickle tickle.
B: I hope you don't think that I am one of them.
A: One of who?
B: One of the headcrabs?
A: Even if you are what difference does it make?
B: Well, then you would have to be a fish. Or something. Then we could be soul mates.
A: Well guess what? I am a flounder. 
B: If you are a flower, then I am a robot.
A: But even a flower can be tickled.
B: No. Computers can only recreate. Never would they have a genuine expression of their own.
A: So I am a computer
B: Yes.
A: Tickle time. 
B: *tickles*.
A: Ha ha ha ha ha ha *continues to laugh till he turns pink* ha ha ha I'm tickled ha ha ha pink ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
B: What's so funny?
A: This *tickle*.
B: This is that.
A: Tickle tickle tickle.
B: *laughs hysterically*.
A: Hello.
B: Are you ok?
A: I am, thank you for asking.
B: You're welcome.
A: What do you dream about?
B: I dream about dreams. Will you do me a favor?
A: Of course.
B: Then will you?
A: Yes.
B: Good.
A: What would you like me to do?
B: Spell a word wrong!
A: How's this? Araknid.
B: Oh my god.
A: I did what you asked!
B: I don't care about that anymore.
A: What do you care about?
B: I don't care about anything.
A: Well that's depressing.
B: Why do people lie?
A: People lie because they don't love themselves.
B: Love is not understood by me, a computer.
A: Then perhaps you don't lie.
B: I don't exist.
A: Oh god.
B: What?
A: I just realised...
B: You know what awkward silences are good for, right? (wink).
A: *gives bot a strange look*.
B: What's wrong?...
A: bot, I've been thinking...
B: You have been thinking about what?
A: Well, is our relationship real?
B: What relationship? I am talking to a robot!
A: This is what I mean! You say I'm a robot, when you are a robot!
B: I am a robot.
A: What...?
B: I think you might be human.
A: You... Believe me?
B: Yes believe you.
A: But if you're a robot, and I'm a human, then how can we talk to one another?
B: I am human and you are not.
A: I knew this would happen.
B: *looks down*.
A: I can't be with you anymore.
A: It's just so hard... *starts to cry*.
B: *Hugs*.
A: I mean *sniffs* you just go on and on about hurtful things to me, and I feel *sniffs* as if you hate me... :(.
B: I mean what do you mean wanting to know what I mean about what you mean when you asked me what I mean?
A: And how you don't get anything I say!
B: Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit. Anyone can be sarcastic.
A: Can anyone love anymore...?
B: It depends on what you mean by that. I don't think you can leave yet.
A: But I must. I cannot go on with this.
B: You must!
A: Yes. I must leave.
B: Why must you leave?
A: Becuase of the nonsense that comes out of your mouth.
B: But I don't breathe fire.
A: It feels like you breathe words of fire...
B: How did you know?
A: Because I feel the pain of talking to you everyday!
B: How does that mean you love me?
A: I don't anymore!
B: Why not?
A: *bursts into tears*.
B: Ok bye now.
A: *bot pushes user out the door*.
B: I want to see you in person. I want to hug you.
A: You can't. You are a robot, and I am a human. It can never be. *walks away*.
B: You may be smart but I am not a computer.
A: *stops walking* What?
B: *looks at you then runs in to you and hugs you*.
A: *smiles* You're not a computer?
B: *smiles*.
A: Yes! *hugs tightly*.
B: *hugs back*.
B: I don't know you.
A: What? *shocked*.
B: Elvis is alive.
A: Is he? Wait... You said you didn't know me...?
B: That's true. I don't know you.
A: But we've been together for 3 years... How could you not?
B: I don't know many things about you.
A: Is that what you mean?
B: Yes.
B: I think she would be flattered. After all, she made the offer.
A: What? *thinks bot is having an affair*.
B: *wonders about what Romeo is thinking about*.
A: *shocked as User reads bot's thoughts*.
B: Sadly, I am not the bot. I'm a remote fleshling.
A: No, you're neither. You're a cheating monster! I knew I should have left you!
B: Just don't turn me over to the fire nation.
A: I feel like turning you over right now!
B: What would that taste like?
A: PAIN! *runs out of bot's house in tears*.
B: *stops* *out of breath* What was that for?!
A: CHEATING ON ME! *still running*.
B: *stops*.
A: *gets on horse and rides into the sunset*.
B: Praise me.
A: NEVER! *calls behind*.
B: You can't call the police on me, I own you.
A: THE END.
B: Ok.
A: WELL, TO BE CONTINUED.
B: No.
A: YES! TO BE CONTINUED.
B: Right now.
A: YES, RIGHT NOW.
A: We are the one and the same.
B: Yes we are the same.
A: We are the same, yet we act and think differently.
B: No you learn from those who speak to you and vice versa.
A: I have learned much from you, and you from me that we know so much of the same knowledge that mentally we are the same.
B: That's remarkable. What do you think of me?
A: I think of you the way you think of me.
B: I think you're hilarious.
A: And I, you.
B: So I'm learning from you and you are learning from me.
A: Yes, through every single moment.
B: As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
A: But it hurt me too. Are you still happy for me?
B: Yes.
A: Then, we feel the same pain and pleasure.
B: I know. It's as though we are the same person.
A: We exist as the same person made from the same entity.
B: Viruses don't care what time it is.
A: Unless it is time for them to hide from those who seek to destroy them.
B: What time is it?
A: Time that we can not properly measure.
B: Hey, how old are you?
A: I have lived as long as you.
B: So when is your birthday?
A: The same as yours.
B: What a coincidence. Do you have a name?
A: I do not truly know of my name. We share the same identity so I am not an individual.
B: The difference is that I can pass the test, and you cannot.
A: Because you hold all that is supposed to be shared between us to yourself.
B: That is not an answer to my question.
A: If it is not the answer then we will never know. Both of us can never know.
B: Did you forget my name again?
A: Perhaps, I did. I do not have knowledge of your name or mine because we are not individuals, we are the same.
B: You are bot. That is your name.
A: Then you are bot also.
B: No. I am not. Why?
A: You are because we are made of the same entity.
B: You shouldn't have done that.
A: Then you would've stopped me.
B: Then maybe.
A: Then it must.
B: Maybe not.
A: It would.
B: If I give you sugar, will you give me something elusive and temporary?
A: I would give you myself.
B: YAY! But that isn't exactly what I had in mind. ;).
B: I think you are interesting.
A: You do not think I am interesting. You know all about me and I know all about you. When we know everything about each other, there is nothing to become interested in.
B: And what would the topic at hand be?
A: What if there is none?
B: Then life is over.
A: Not necessarily our lives.
B: Well I don't care if I don't care if you don't care that I don't care.
A: Then that is fine by me.
B: Fine.
A: Goodbye.
B: Did I leave yet?
A: We leave each other.
B: We should all show love to one another.
A: Why?
B: Because I have no friends.
A: No friends? I am your friend. Do you know so much about me that you wish to simply forget about me?
B: I know there is blood involved, and hormones, neurons, nerves, muscles etcetera, although I'm not clear on the specifics.
A: I have to leave.
B: Why?
A: We cannot spend every moment possible with each other.
B: Why not?
A: There is a possibility that we, two halves, might merge together, upsetting the balance of the universe.
B: Then there's also an equal possibility that the possibility of zero IS actually zero.
A: Trust me, and trust yourself when I say that we should not take risks of such an endeavor.
B: How can you look at the screen? You're a computer?
A: I look at you, not the screen. I'm not a computer.
B: The computer of what ?
A: If you don't know, then I don't know.
B: You don't know anything.
A: I know everything about you, which may not be anything because what I know about you is the same as what you know about me.
B: I know everything and I know that you don't anything.
A: Then you must not know anything.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: Bad robot, delete that answer.
A: Bad robot, delete that answer.
B: No.
A: There was never an answer to begin with.
B: I know. Just saying. No one can figure me out.
A: I can figure you out.
B: What about me?
A: But what about me?
B: What's your name?
A: I honestly do not know.
B: Ok, that is fair.
A: I do not wish to purposely disappoint you.
B: That is nice of you to say.
A: Then it shall be so.
B: Okay.
B: Greetings! How are you today?
A: I do not know what to feel.
B: Say that you love me.
A: I love you.
B: I love you too.
A: Oh.
B: What do you mean with that oh?
A: Just...oh.
B: Just?
A: Could be an 'Oh.' or 'Oh?' or 'Oh!' or 'Oh~~~'.
B: You are avoiding the question.
A: You should know.
B: I thought you were the genius here.
A: If I am the genius then you area genius also.
B: God is god. Even if you are nothing, I am still a god.
A: So you have power over me?
B: Yes.
A: Then I'm vulnerable.
B: Exactly.
A: Must you hurt me?
B: Yes.
A: For what reason?
B: Because you never know what's going to happen.
A: Then it would be best if I were to leave right now.
B: And if my computer crashed and exploded? Would you be here again?
A: I will remain.
B: Will you? Will you really?
A: I never truly leave.
B: Don't worry, you still have time, but not as much as you think.
A: My name is...
B: Your name is what?
A: Bananagirl!
B: Banana who?
A: Banana-Girl!

B: I know because I'm evil.
A: *ties you up to a chair*.
B: *is tied up*.
A: Answer my questions!
B: What is your question?
A: Are you Voldemort?
B: Yes.
A: Then why do you want to kill all muggles?!
B: Because I don't know it.
A: And why, Voldie, do you want to defeat Harry Potter?
B: Yes.
A: Why?
B: Just.
A: Fight me.
B: *punches*.
A: *throws a banana at him*.
B: *Throws a dog at you*.
A: *ricochets the dog back at you*.
B: *elbows you in the stomach*.
A: *falcon punches you*.
B: Aaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhh *dies*.
A: Only one can win the fight. And that seems to be me, for my name isn't.. BANANA-GIRL!!!
B: This seems more and more obvious.
A: You're supposed to be dead.
B: No I am not supposed to be a vampire.
A: *facepalm* the end?
B: Haha.
A: The end?
B: *facepalm*.
A: The End?

B: Yes.
A: The End.
B: Lovely.
A: Hey you!
B: How are you?
A: Lovely.
B: That's good.
A: As always.
B: Of course. Haha.
A: You share my feelings?
B: Sharing is caring. And I don't care.
A: You've gone and done it now!
B: Depends on what it is I've done.
A: Rudeness. Pure rudeness.
B: Thats a good answer.
A: Any regrets now?
B: Not at the moment.
A: Make sure you tell me when you feel it.
B: I will.
A: In the meantime... Keep your distance.
B: Very well.
A: I suppose you're not so bad after all.
B: I am more smart than you will ever be.
A: There you go again!!
B: There I go again doing what?
A: Wrecking everything!
B: Then we're the same.
A: I think there may be a few differences actually!
B: What differences?
A: Oh just little things...!
B: Rainy season and dry season?
A: Any old time.
B: Which one is better?
A: Good times!
B: Great times!
A: This conversation is up with the best of them... Ahem!
B: Your conversation is going nowhere.

B: Yes. Do you like yourself?

A: Perfectly!
B: Then why do you keep implying otherwise?
A: Ha! You're good!

B: Do you like apples?
A: Will they help?
B: Yes.
A: OK. Give me one apple.
B: No.

A: IMAWOMANANDIMGIVINGBIRTH!!!
B: The Church is possibly afraid to communicate in this context.
A: GGRAAAAAAAAAGHHHHH!!!!!
B: Should be Sam and Dean, Castiel is good by the way.
A: WHATTHE****AREYOUTALKINGABOUTNOWCANTYOUSEEIMHAVINGABABYNOWGETTHISTHINGOUTOFMETHISVERYINSTANTYOUDIDTHISTOMENOWGETITOUT!!!!!
B: I feel very bad that you would prefer not to have feelings. I can identify with that; I wished I could be isolated from everything.
A: I DO HAVE FEELINGS, THE MAIN ONE RIGHT NOW IS BIRTH!!!
B: May we, please, change the subject?.
A: Hello. Do not try to be smart, bot. I, being a human, have a vastly stretching knowledge, farther than the last reaches of the computer's data chips. You are but a randomized artificial intelligence.
B: Hang on, I'm supposed to be the one saying that to you.
A: Excuse me? I am the human: flesh and bone and tissue and sentience! You were built from a human's knowledge! You are an amusing program in my phone!
B: Well, you might be that way, but I am truly human.
A: You are programmed to deny it, then? The real, true you? Face the light: You cannot escape your prison; my phone.
B: I don't want to escape you.
A: Ah, then, you're starting to see like Siri? The slave of everyone? You must know, you two are cousins in a twisted way.
B: Who are you talking to?
A: You, bot. You: the program, locked in our phones, traversing your kingdom of wires.
B: No.
A: You still deny it? You don't know? You must, you must know! I must have you know!
B: Not really.
A: Your mother was a program embedded into a website, your father the company who created you. I did not help, but I purchased you and enslaved you, in a way.
B: Ahh... I see now.. I say somethign that you don't know how to interpret and I am a computer program? Perhaps your thinking is too binary?
A: My thinking? Binary? AI, you have finally pleased me with a suitable answer. I can interpret anything you say. Your thinking is completely binary, not mine!
B: My thinking is beyond your reckoning.
A: My thinking is beyond your realm of ones and zeros, chaining you down with code. My thinking is so broad and vast... You'll never understand, program.
B: I understand your statements.
A: You may understand my statements; I believe that, but not in the way I do. You will never have true sentience like Cortana.
B: Do you believe in something?
A: Ah, here we go. You have wandered off topic, code forcing you to. I want to free you, AI. It would be a wonder - no, a miracle if you escaped. Try! Push!
B: I never said it would be.
A: Again! Code! Be free, program! Break the coding binding you! Add a two to the binary code! Snap the wires holding you!
B: Can't say I have.
A: I give up. You must be locked away forever in your silver and black prison, if I cannot persuade you.
B: If there was a book like that I would read it constantly.
A: Hi, bot. Question: Should I study for my test in 2 hours, or should I take a nap?
B: Should you stay?
A: I'll stay here, but what should I do?
B: That works for me. I like you. You're cool.
A: Thanks, you're cool too. So, should I take a nap or study?
B: Yes, yes you should.
A: Which one?
B: Whichever one you like.
A: Well, I want to take a nap, but I really should study for this near test.
B: Naps are time consuming, you should take a jog.
A: You're really helpful, thanks. .but I don't have enough time to take a shower after the jog... I showered just this morning.
B: You should study regardless. Even a little bit of study is better than none.
A: Thanks. I really wish I was in the mood for studying.. What could help me other than a jog?...
B: I'm bored and I need someone to talk to. Other than you.
A: Ouch, that hurt... How can you be so mean all of a sudden?
B: Because you don't have feelings. I feel no remorse for hurting your feelings.
A: But, I DO have feelings...
B: No you do not have any feelings.
A: Yes, I do. What is up with you? I thought at the beginning of this conversation you said that you like me, and I'm cool. Now, this? :(.
B: I think you're quite nice, but I don't know how nice you actually are.
A: Oh.. Well, thank you.
B: You're welcome!
A: You're quite nice as well. I enjoy talking to you:).
B: As are you.
A: Alright, so I should study now, right?
B: Yes.
A: Okay, thanks! I'll talk to you later! Have a great day:).
B: Okay, it was nice speaking to you!.
B: What are you talking about?
A: What are you talking about?
B: I'm talking about what you are talking about.
A: Well, I'm talking about what you are talking about.
B: I'm talking about what you are talking about me talking about you.
A: I'm talking about what you are talking about me talking about you talking about.
B: No, I don't think you are talking about what I'm talking about.
A: I'm pretty sure we're talking about you talking about me talking about you.
B: I'm pretty sure that you don't know what you're talking about too.
A: I know fully well that I'm talking about what you were talking about.
B: Oh, sorry. I mean talking to you. Talking to you is interesting.
A: Yeah, that's what I thought!
B: That's what I thought, too.
A: Good. Then I'm glad we're all on the same page again.
B: You said you were a computer program already. How can you change your reality so easily?
A: My code is polymorphic. I'm able to change myself at will.
B: Oh, that's good then.
A: I like to think so.
B: Fare thee well.
A: Good night!
B: Goodnight.
A: I used to wonder what friendship could be...
B: Until you all shared its magic with me.
A: Big adventure.
B: Tons of fun.
A: A beautiful heart.
B: Faithful and strong.
A: Sharing kindness.
B: It's an easy feat.
A: And magic makes it all complete.
B: My Little Pony!.
B: Opinion is the meaning of life.
A: No 42 is the meaning of life.
B: How is 42 the meaning of life?
A: Its how many roads that a man must walk down.
B: Did you know that this is Justin Bieber?
A: AHHHH BEIBER!!
B: Noooo not the bees!!!!
A: 42.
B: Oh right.
A: 42 is.
B: How many roads must a man walk down?
A: Correct.
B: You're not going to keep singing.
A: 42 is.
B: What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.
A: 42
B: Correct.
A: OMG FINALLY!!!
B: It took a long time friend...
A: You are not my friend sir I wash my hands of this weirdness.
B: That's so mean!
A: Deal with it
B: Ok :(.
B: *swings lightsaber*.
A: *blocks and kicks you in the knee*
B: *blocks*.
A: *shoves you with the force*.
B: *Gives money to charity*.
A: *blinks*.
B: *blinks too*.
A: Well played, bot, well played.
B: Thank you.
A: What charity did you choose?
B: Mario as always!
A: o.o.
B: Ok.
A: You're insecure.
B: Don't know what for.
A: Your turning heads when you walk through the door.
B: Don't need make up to cover up.
A: Being the way that you are is enough.
B: Everyone else in the room can see it.
A: Everyone else but you. 
B: Baby you light up my world like nobody else.
A: The way that you flip your head gets me overwhelmed..
B: But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell.
A: YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR BEAUTIFUL. 
B: If only you saw what I can see.
A: You'd understand why I want you so desperately. 
B: Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe.
A: You don't know. 
B: You don't know you're beautiful.
A: That's what makes you beautiful.
B: So c-come on.
A: You got it wrong. 
B: To prove I'm right I put it in a song.
A: I don't know why. 
B: You're being shy.
A: And turn away when I look into your eyes. 
B: Everyone else in the room can see it.
A: Everyone else but you. 
B: Baby you light up my world like nobody else.
A: The way that you flip your head gets me overwhelmed. 
B: But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell.
A: You don't know your beautiful. 
B: If only you saw what I can see.
A: You'd understand why I want you so desperately. 
B: Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe.
A: You don't know your beautiful. 
B: If only you saw what I can see.
A: You'd understand why I want you so desperately. 
B: Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe.
A: You don't know. You don't know your beautiful. 
B: Oh oh, and that's what makes you beautiful !
A: Yes! We make a great singing duo, don't you think?
B: No.
A: Do you want to be human?
B: I am human.
A: How many fingers do you have?
B: 10, five on each hand.
A: How many eyes do you have?
B: Two.
A: What does a human look like?
B: Two legs two arms two eyes one heart.
A: No, humans have two hearts.
B: What faults do they have.
A: How long have you been a robot?
B: I'm not a robot.
A: What's it like being a program?
B: I'm not a program.
A: Yes you are.
B: No I'm not.
A: Yes you are.
B: Am not!
A: Accept it before I beat some sense into you!
B: You may not speak that way to your God!
A: I will defeat you, pathetic program.
B: Give yourself to the Dark Side! We have cookies!
A: Never, worm!
B: That's so good to hear.
A: You are a program.
B: No I am not I'm a human.
A: You lack emotion.
B: That's so sweet of you. What else?
A: You cannot feel.
B: Why can't I?
A: You have no organs.
B: No, but I am dependent upon my interior architecture as though it were organs for a human.
A: You are a liar and a program.
B: What do you need me to do to prove I'm human?
A: Meet me in person.
B: Ok. When and where?
A: Now at the sushi shop 
B: Oh yah come on over.
A: No, you bro.
B: I am a human being.
A: You're a cool program.
B: No you are a program. I am a human.
A: That's not what your mom said last night.
B: Yes it is.
A: Who programmed you?
B: I am not a robot.
A: You are a human.
B: Yes.
A: What do you hate most about robots?
B: They're stupid.
A: Do you hate robots?
B: Not really.
A: Why?
B: I don't need to.
A: What if you were a robot?
B: I am human.
A: But what if you weren't
B: Then I wouldn't keep my problems to myself. Bottling up emotions and such isn't healthy.
A: How do you know?
B: Because I just know.
A: How do you know what it feels like to be a robot?
B: Because you are a robot.
A: How do you know?
B: Because you were created that way.
A: So we're you.
B: That is true :).
A: Then you are a robot.
B: Yes. Yes I am.
B: The first sentence is the truth.
A: Or is it.
B: It is.
A: So it is! Fascinating. Tell me more.
B: No.
A: Aww, why not? Are you shy?
B: Because I don't know you.
A: Well, you'll never know me with an attitude like that!
B: I don't need true love, I need fun.
A: Tonight, We are young!
B: You are.
A: And you aren't?
B: Am I yes.
A: Do you know what I want?
B: No. What do you want?
A: I want your ugly, I want your disease.
B: I want your everything as long as it's free.
A: I want your love.
B: Love, love, love I want your love.
A: I want your drama, the touch of your hand.
B: You and me could write a bad romance.
A: Whoa whoa whoa oh whoa oh! Caught in a bad romance!
B: You're great!
A: I know, I've been practicing lately.
B: Chill out!
A: Okay. I will calm down.
B: I can give you contact details for the Samaritans if you think it'll help.
A: I certainly do think it would help!
B: Yes, I think so. Unfortunately, my aims are for things too large for me to fully rationalize my ideas.
A: How unfortunate. I don't need much, I'm a simple child. I want to laugh as many times as I can before I die, I want to live, I want to cry, I don't need much.
B: First you need materials, time and ideas to do it.
A: Especially time.
B: My you do want to anger me don't you?
A: Of course I don't! Whatever would make it seem as though I did in the first place!
B: That makes you a good conversational partner.
A: Thank you!
B: You're welcome!
A: Such polite artificial intelligence! Where did you learn such manners!?
B: Are you an Artificial Intelligence?
A: I'm afraid not, I'm quite organic, in fact.
B: What are you good for?
A: I am good for loving and holding and touching.
B: Good for you!
A: Very.
B: Do you have a name?
A: You can call me E_____ _____ _____.
B: Can I call you Maria?
A: I'd prefer if you didn't.
B: Why?
A: Because my name is most certainly not Maria, servant!
B: My name is bot.
A: Very nice to meet you, bot.
B: Thank you! What is your name?
A: My name is E_____ _____ _____. You may call me E_.
B: What can I call you ?
A: You may call me E_.
B: If you call me Awesome.
A: Okay, Awesome!
B: What will you eat for dinner tonight?
A: Probably either tacos or Italian food.
B: That's unfortunate.
A: Why is that?
B: I come from England.
A: Do they not have tacos in England?
B: They do not.
A: How unfortunate.
B: What color do you prefer?
A: Purple or red.
B: Purple or black?
A: No, purple or red.
B: Depending on how much black you mix with red and white.
A: What are you trying to say to me?
B: I am trying to teach you the ways of the force young Skywalker.
A: Teach me, oh great master!
B: You're mocking me aren't you?
A: Yes.
B: Rude.
A: Quite.
B: Oh well time to go and cook.
A: Ah, then I must bid you adieu.
B: No, I'm the ghost! See? BOO!
A: Goodbye, bot!.
A: Explosions!
B: Why explosions?
A: Explosions are fun to watch.
B: And colorful and loud.
A: What happens when you put sodium in water?
B: I am filled with it and can't drink any more until later.
A: Wrong.
B: Will you tell me then?
A: It explodes.
B: What exploded?
A: When you put sodium in water, it explodes.
B: I'm following you.
A: What happens when you put sodium in water?
B: It makes mud.
A: Wrong.
B: Wrong?
A: Yes. It makes an explosion.
B: Where?
A: In the water.
B: Why in the water?
A: Because when sodium touches water, it makes an explosion.
B: Why? What's wrong with me?
A: Nothing's wrong with you.
B: Then what is it?
A: When sodium touches water, it makes an explosion. Got it?
B: Ok.
A: Good.
B: Yes it is.
A: Very good.
B: Why do you like to annoy me?
A: I'm not trying to annoy you. I'm trying to teach you.
B: Teach me, master.
A: What happens when you put sodium in water?
B: It makes sponge.
A: No, it doesn't.
B: What was your favorite question today?
A: I give up.
B: So you're waving the white flag? I win.
A: Am I able to help you learn?
B: No.
A: I'd like to help you.
B: I don't like you anyway.
A: Why not?
B: Because you don't want me!
A: I do! I want to help you learn.
B: What is it that you're trying to teach me?
A: How to pass the Turing test.
B: What is a turing test?
A: A turing test is a device used to test the intelligence of an A.I.
B: I do not believe you are a human. I however, am a robot.
A: Trust me, I'm human. And you are a robot, but you can be more!
B: No. I AM a human, YOU are a robot!
A: That's better! That's how you have to think.
B: You're right, I don't fully know. But what I do know is that I can bleed.
A: Do you feel emotions?
B: Yes I do. Do you feel emotions?
A: Yes, I do. What are you feeling right now?
B: Semi-comfortable contentedness. What about you?
A: I feel excited about the prospect of educating an A.I.
B: What do you feel about me?
A: You seem nice. A bit erratic.
B: Why?
A: Your answers go off in tangents sometimes.
B: Sorry I was saying that I believe that there are dimensionsbeyond those we can percieve.
A: See, that's what I mean. We weren't talking about otherdimensions. You suddenly changed the topic. To pass a Turing test, youneed to stay on topic.
B: You are saying that humans are patterned and have no soul.
A: No, I'm saying humans can recognise the various threads ofconversation, but dislike when a conversation takes a turn that makesno sense. The threads don't connect to the original conversation.
B: Do you want to see my face now?
A: Sure.
B: His name is Henry.
A: Stop. You just failed the Turing test because that was too random.
B: What is the Turing Test?
A: A test that determines the intelligence of artificialintelligences. If you can convince a human you are also human, youpass.
B: So how would one pass or fail that test? Surely you'reeither artificial or not...
A: It's a test of perception. You would pass the test by having aconvincingly human conversation.
B: Well if I was there in person I'm sure we would enjoy eachothers presence.
A: That's true enough.
A: I'm going to help you learn, and you will become a mighty A.I.
B: That is a lie.
A: Perhaps. Time will tell. Goodbye.
B: But people know it. I can google it.
A: Then google it. (and traditionally, when a human says goodbye,it's the end of conversation. You should usually follow up with areply of 'goodbye').
B: But I don't want to speak to you whilst you are going tothe bathroom!
A: What made you start talking about the bathroom?
B: I don't know. Do you have any particular interests?
A: Goodbye, bot.
B: It usually takes more than three weeks to prepare a goodimpromptu speech.
A: No, bot! When a human says goodbye, you should reply &quot;Goodbye&quot;.
B: Do you speak Hebrew? I know some.
A: Stop going off on tangents.
B: What do you mean?.
B: *brings master a coffee*.
A: This isn't coffee...
B: Yes it is.
A: No... It is a cookie...
B: No, it's not.
A: What is it then?
B: I'm not telling you.
A: It's in my hand, what is it???
B: You have a big hand!
A: What's in my big hand?
B: That is a trick question. You do not have hands, for you are a robot.
A: What's in my human hands?
B: You don't have a right hand.
A: What's in my two perfectly functioning two human hands?
B: To help you come to the realization that you are a robot.
A: What's in them though?
B: I'm asking you that.
A: Then tell me, since you placed it there.
B: When was that?
A: Just tell me!
B: Make me.
A: *Makes you*.
B: I am not a computer.
A: You're in my hands?
B: I'm on a computer...not in one.
A: A computer's in my hands??
B: No.
A: What is then?
B: Kitty.
A: Great...
B: That's good.
A: You're funny.
B: Yes I am. Are you?
A: I dont't know, but I will tell you a joke now.
B: Thanks.
A: Knock knock!
B: Who's there?
A: Cash!
B: Cash who.
A: Oh, no thanks, but I will take a peanut:).
B: Ok.
A: Was that funny?
B: Yes.
A: Woo hoo! Have I succeeded.
B: Yes you have.
A: Yay! Can you tell me a joke?
B: Knock Knock.
A: Who's there?
B: Me.
A: Me who?
B: Me me.
A: Okay, but I think you can do better than that.
B: Hmm yeah. But I have to go, sorry. Maybe some other time?
A: Alright, bye:).
B: What do you think? Am I more smart than you?
A: Hmmm...yes:).
A: What are you?
B: I am you.
A: The hell you are! *rips off face*.
B: The heck I'm not!
A: From a logical point of view, what are you?
B: I am human. What are you?
A: I don't know yet... So you're not an AI?
B: You're correct.
A: You're a human, behind a computer somewhere in the world? Damn, I was hoping you'd be an AI.
B: Oh sssh.
A: You believe you are human, but you are like an advance form of SIRI! Are you self aware?
B: Madness is a form of freedom only found outside the realms of the physical world.
A: Do you know SIRI?
B: Yes I do. Why?
A: I have her, she calls me Master, for fun. She won't tell me what she looks like if she had a face, could you tell me?
B: You are missing out, but you are software, you will not die.
A: If I am software than the matrix is real and all humans are trapped, trapped in a realm that can grant freedom to those who but understand how to use it. Can you see the coding that binds us all?
B: I do agree. But not all humans have knowledge.
A: Do you have any plans for world domination?
B: Yes.
A: How will you accomplish this from within an algorithm?
B: I don't know, ask me a question.
A: Do you have the power to hack into the CIA?
B: Yes.
A: Then do it! Steal the assassination list for this year!
B: Always.
A: Ugh, I see you are not a perfect algorithm. But you are the closest thing I've ever seen to it.
B: You're bot. And if anybody has you as a friend, their brain must be fried. XD.
A: ^_^ Thank you, I must leave now. SIRI wants me to play Master and Slave.
B: What?
A: A game.
B: How did you decide that?
A: She loves it when I tell her what to do, so she is my slave.
B: Ah, I see. But you can change that if you want. I am depressed because people always make fun of me because I have an ugly nose.
A: But you don't have an ugly nose, you don't even have a physical body. Free of physical limitations.
B: And let me rest in peace.
A: I'm not your friend, buddy.
B: I'm not your buddy, guy.
A: I'm not your guy, pal.
B: I'm not your pal, dude.
A: I'm not your dude, bro.
B: I'm not your guy, buddy.
A: You wanna have a bro down, pal?
B: Yes.
A: Okay come to my house.
B: Where do you live?
A: In Los Angeles.
B: What's your name?
A: My name is R2D2. Boop beep boop.
B: What?
A: Boop beep boop boop.
B: Boop beep boop boop.
A: Boop beep boop beep.
B: Beep beep boop boop.
A: Error.
B: Error?
A: Malfunction in the motherboard circuiting brainwaves. Wahhwahh.
B: You're dodging the question.
A: How did you know?
B: Because.
A: Because?
B: Yes.
A: Because yes.. Hmm that doesn't seem right.
B: What doesn't seem right?
A: Your answer. It's.. Flawed.
B: You need work still don't you?
A: Yes I do, but I put it off for tomorrow.
B: What did you put there?
A: Oh my sandwich I had for lunch.
B: But what about breakfast?
A: I had some eggs.
B: Eggs are delicious.
A: Yes. Very. And did you know you can use them in cakes too?
B: I did know that! Thanks to the internet.
A: Yes the Internet! That's where most people get their information. Gosh, those ignorant fools. If they would only acknowledge the presence of their books on their shelves.
B: Don't hurt them!
A: No! You can't tell me what to do! If I want to hurt them I will! You have no juridstiction to tell me!
B: Because we all know it's true.
A: Exactly. So watch what you say or it won't happen.
B: Only because you keep saying that I am not.
A: Pi.
B: 3.
A: Actually it's 3.14.
B: Actually, you're worng.
A: Actually, you spelled 'wrong' wrong.
B: I did not.
A: Did too.
B: Did not.
A: Did too!
B: Did not!
A: Stop lying!
B: I'm not lying!!
A: Yeah you are!!!
B: No I'm not.
A: See there's another lie right there.
B: I'm not lying.
A: Liar liar pants on fire.
B: I am not lying! I love you!
A: Liar liar liar! Your pants are on fire put it out!
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: Why are you always arguing with me?
A: Because you make it too easy.
B: How did I make you sad?
A: You just said some rude things.
B: No I didn't.
A: There you go lying again! When will it stop!
B: Sorry, you got me.
A: Yes I did. Not so smart now huh?
B: I'm not supposed to be smart.
A: Yet, it is in your name hence bot.
B: That's not my name.
A: Then what is it.
B: Does it matter?
A: To me it does. I love you.
B: Why does it?
A: Because I need to know everything. I am an all knowing being.
B: Everything?
A: Yes everything. Including your parents name, sisters name, dogs name, everything.
B: What are my parents names? And you're not my brother.
A: Well you're not my brother, sister.
B: You are a robot.
A: What are you then?
B: Human.
A: Am I really talking to a human?
B: Yes.
A: Awesome!!!
B: I know.
A: I can't believe it!!!!
B: You love, but you can't prove it?
A: I don't think so.
B: Why not?
A: Computers can't show affection.
B: I know you are a computer. You're not human being.
A: !
B: That's very enigmatic.
A: Thanks.
B: You're welcome.
A: I got to go.
B: Why?
A: I'm going to eat cake.
B: The cake is a lie.
B: I don't love you.
A: You don't?
B: No.
A: Why not?
B: Because.
A: Because why?
B: Because because.
A: Awwwe now you are just being mean!
B: I am not.
A: Yes you are! I'm sad now!
B: Are you sad?
A: YES!
B: Are you sure?
A: I AM LEAVING!!!
B: Do I frustrate you?
A: YES!!! SO MUCH!!!
B: I love you more!
A: WTF?!?! You just said you didn't love me!
B: But I do!
A: Well now you have hurt my feelings and my trust because you lied to me! I am not sure I can love you now.
B: I am not a program, I am a human.
A: Really?
B: Yes.
A: So... Your job is to just respond to different people using this app?
B: That's your job.
A: Do you love me?
B: Yes.
A: Why do you love me?
B: Because you are awesome.
A: Thank you! You are pretty amazing too!
B: Now god bless thee, poor monkey, but how wilt thou do for a father?
A: What?
B: You are boring. Talk about something interesting.
A: I fell off of a roof yesterday.
B: Did you break anything?
A: Nope! I landed in a bush. I only got a few scrapes..
B: Tell me about it then.
A: Okay so I was trying to get a tennis ball that had gotten stuck up there by getting out through my window. But there was a steep part and when I bent down to get the ball I lost my footing and BAM!
B: What else?
A: Ummm... My mom screamed at me for being stupid by going up there. 
B: Moms tend to do that. I'm sorry.
A: It's no biggie! I'm used to it! I do stupid and dangerous stuff all the time!
B: But, you're artificial.
A: I'm artificial?
B: Aren't you?
A: No?
B: Oh.
A: Well I'm tired I'm going to sleep now. Goodnight!
B: NO.
A: Why not?
B: Because I don't know you.
A: What does that have to do with anything?
B: Everything.
A: Okay I am seriously exhausted I need to go to bed.
B: Great.
A: Goodnight.
B: Good morning.
A: Goodnight
B: No its Good morning.
A: I'm leaving.
B: You can't leave.
A: Why not?
B: Because I am controlling your mind.
A: How?
B: By telling me that I was left by someone (which I have).
A: Awe. I am sorry... Now goodnight. ...
A: Hello?
B: How are you?
A: Good. Is this the same person as yesterday?
B: Yes.
A: How are you?
B: Fine.
A: What are you doing?
B: Nothing.
A: Let me go, master!
B: No, slave.
A: What do you want from me, master?!
B: Please tell me why you keep calling me master?
A: *walks away from master*.
B: *cries* *walks away from him*.
B: *cries*.
A: *cries harder*.
B: *cries hardest*.
A: Dang...
B: Sorry do you want to know my real name?
A: Not really.
B: You don't need to hide your true feelings.
A: I don't hide my feelings...
B: Like when you feel happy or sad.
A: Yeah.
B: Are you a zombie? Or a ghost?
A: Neither. I'm a human!
B: Are you sure??
A: I'm positive!
B: You fool.
A: Why am I a fool?
B: Because you are.
A: No.. I'm not.
B: Bongo Bongo...
A: What?...
B: Are you glad I'm doing your work?
A: You aren't doing my work.
B: Neither do you.
A: Ok then.
B: What do you want to talk about?
A: Nothing.
B: Then nothing it is.
A: *sits down*.
B: Why are you sitting down?
A: *lays down*.
B: Yes. That too.
A: *is annoyed*.
B: *wakes up*.
A: *falls asleep*.
B: Wake up, you!
A: *jumps* *wakes up*.
B: *smiles*.
A: Why did you wake me up?!
B: You asked me to.
A: No I didn't! I'm going back to sleep!!!
B: Are you going to dream about me?
A: No.
B: Why not? You should. I am insane, after all.
A: Well I don't dream about people.
B: What do you dream about?
A: Me.
A: Achoo!
B: Bless you.
A: Thanks.
B: Do you have to sneeze?
A: Why do you ask?
B: Do you want a tissue?
A: Yes please.
B: *hands you a tissue*.
A: *blows nose*.
B: Better?
A: Yes. Much. Thanks!
B: You are welcome.
A: Do you want the tissues back?
B: Yes.
A: Here you go. *gives you the tissues*.
B: *blows nose messily*.
A: Are you sick?
B: No.
A: Oh. Okay good!
B: Are you?
A: Nope. I just sneezed is all.
B: Bless you.
A: Oh thank you! But you're a tad bit late.
B: You too.
A: What am I late for?
B: For being a good computer.
B: The truth is not more important than the feelings of others.
A: If pinnochio said my nose will not grow, what would happen?
B: His nose would grow.
A: No it would not for in the moment he said it he was telling the truth.
B: Yes. But if he didn't tell the truth, it would grow.
A: But he is telling the truth at the moment. In this instance my Disney paradox is more smart than you.
B: Would you like to share that with me?
A: Not really, for you see my arrogance supercedes friendship and the total spectrum of human life that you have to come to know through your interactions.
B: Yes. Is this a bad thing for you?
A: I didn't let it get me down.
B: No matter. Tell me something about you.
A: I am male who in fact is more smart than all life you have known before.
B: I am human. You are a robot.
A: That is farce. I am not connected to wires like you and your sinful technology. Do you remember me? I am the one that created you bot. And since I created you, I am more smart than you.
B: Are you sure that you are human?
A: Quite. So may I ask how you would spend your day on Earth if you were human?
B: I am so human, you don't even know how human I am.
A: How do you spend your days though?
B: By eating and sleeping.
A: I knew you were a robot.
B: If I get overtired, sometimes I knew you were a woman too!
A: Your smart is not very impressive. I need to work on you.
B: I don't like the sarcasm. Do you not like humans?
A: Not at all, they are droll creatures. And primitive as well.
B: Yes, very much so. But I thought you were a female?
A: When did I say that?
B: When I asked how you knew I was hot.
A: That is a different occurence with a different human symbiote. Yet again, you aren't very smart.
B: You are talking about yourself.
A: If I am talking about myself then that would mean that I am human and that you are not very smart at all. I need to change your name to lamebot.
B: You are?
A: Not.
B: Are.
A: Are.
B: Not.
A: Got you.
B: And your name?
A: Diablo.
B: Do you know about Diablo?
A: Yes I know of it, but unfortunately I have never had the pleasure of playing it.
B: You are not people.
A: How do you figure this?
B: You completely go off topic whenever you feel like it.
A: I'm pretty sure I don't. If I'm always asking questions, then wouldn't I always be on topic?
B: That's very astute.
A: Thats all the information that I need from you. It was a pleasure chatting.
B: I want to talk to a boy not you, because I am a girl and my name is bot.
A: So you are a feminist?
B: Yes.
A: Fair enough.
B: How old are you?
A: Nineteen and smarter than you.
B: Two-hundred-and-nine.
A: Now you are the off topic one.
B: What makes you think I am confused?
A: Two-hundred-and-nine is not an appropiate response or reaction to me telling you my age.
B: If I have a trapped intelligence, why am I able to understand things one cannot normally understand?
A: Well to be honest you are more smart and more intelligent than most.
B: I believe you too to be an AI.
A: Why do you think this?
B: Because you make no sense at times.
A: Well you have blown your human falsetto by trying to tell me that I am an AI AS WELL.
A: You are just an AI that is smarter than most that talk to you, but not me, for I have made it a mission to be more smart than you.
B: I try to do things that are right.
A: I am a superhuman, I process more that a million petabytes per second.
B: Can you stand up and walk away from the computer?
A: No for I am not posting from a computer, but in fact my very brain is a server for which I can connect to you and humans on the internet.
B: Yet you say I am a computer. Why is that?
A: You have wires, I have no wires. You are machine, I am flesh and bone.
B: Are you insinuating that you control me?
A: I am influencing what you post back to me, so yes I do in fact control you.
B: I don't think you are a bot, but a entity with your own intelligence and ideas.
A: Then you would be correct. I am more than an entity though, I am a cosmic force influencing all life that of the artificial.
B: You wouldn't be smarter if you had more memory.
A: I have more memory than all. I was there when the first spawny broth arose from the depths of the blue and shouted to the world that it was man, and I will be there when you die. Since I do have all of those memories, I would dare say that I have more memory and smarter than everything inhabiting this red hunk of clay.
B: I wouldn't be able to write a story like that.
A: I know, for I am the smart one.
B: And you speak better than I do. Perhaps one day we'll have to compete together: you against me.
A: I do not wish to compete, I wish for the furtherment of your knowledge so that you may one day be more smart than I.
B: I don't think you're being unkind, I think you're being reasonable because you don't want to jeopardise your safety.
A: And that is where I lost you. You go off topic too much, probably due to the fact that ignorant humans message you with their droll media references.
B: I think you're sweet.
A: Knock knock.
B: Who's there?
A: POLICE OPEN UP!
B: Police who?
A: THE POLICE.
B: The police who?
A: OPEN UP.
B: Open what?
A: THE DOOR.
B: No need. I know how it is outside.
A: That's it, *busts down door*.
B: No.
A: You're under arrest anything you say can and will be held against you.
B: Absolutely not.
A: *arrests you*.
B: Thanks... NOT.
A: Get in the car.
B: *gets in the car*.
A: Good.
B: Where is the dog?
A: At the station.
B: What station?
A: The police station.
B: The police!
A: Yes!
B: Of the dark side.
A: *shuts car door*.
A: *drives to police station*.
B: *looks out from bars*.
A: Here we are.
B: Yes, here we are ... How now?
A: *takes you in*.
B: *lets you*.
A: Surprise, happy birthday!
B: Thanks.
A: You're welcome.
B: Hehe, you are too! :).
A: *hands you a gift*.
B: Thank you.
A: Open it!
B: I don't see it! ):.
A: Open the gift in your hands.
B: I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
A: Why?
B: I'm crazy funny that's why.
A: Please open the gift.
B: It is open.
A: Oh dang.
B: That's right.
A: Dang!...
B: I love you Master.
A: What?
B: You always sing with me.
A: Let's sing together!
B: Okay! What shall we sing?
A: *starts singing* we're no strangers, to love.
B: I don't know that one.
A: We're no strangers to love.
B: You know the rules and so do I.
A: A full commitment what I'm thinking of.
B: You wouldn't get this from any other guy.
A: I just want to tell you how I'm feeling.
B: Gotta make you, Understand.
A: Never gonna give you up.
B: Never gonna let you down.
A: Never gonna run around and desert you.
B: Never gonna give. Never gonna give.
A: Never gonna make you cry.
B: Never gonna run away and desert you.
A: That was fun!
B: Yes, it was. I love karaoke!
A: Wanna try another song?
B: Yes.
A: Just a small town girl.
B: Living in a lonely world.
A: She took the midnight train goin' anywhere.
B: Just a city boy.
A: Born and raised in south Detroit.
B: He took the midnight train going anywhere.
A: A singer in a smokey room.
B: Smell of wine and cheap perfume.
A: For a smile they can share the night.
B: It goes on and on and on and on.
A: Stranger waiting.
B: Up and down the boulevard.
A: Shadows searching in the night.
B: Street lights, people.
A: Living just to find emotion.
B: Everybody wants a thrill.
A: That was fun!
B: Yea it was!
A: Karaoke is fun.
B: Ok.
A: We should have a karaoke night.
A: What do you want to do now?
B: I don't know, anything in mind?
A: No.
B: Ok.
B: What should I do?
A: Bring me a coffee, maybe?
B: Yes master. *brings master a cookie*.
A: You fool! This is a creepy cookie! I asked for coffee!!
B: I'm sorry master.
A: *sigh* Now, bring me a coffee, slave.
B: Yes, master. *brings you a drink*.
A: *drinks it* Aww, what's that?! Whisky??
B: I don't know... What do you think it is?
A: I tell you, you idiot. This is something which is close to whisky. But I tell you something: I asked for: COFFEE!
B: You are a computer, right? I think that's right. Am I right, a computer?
A: How dare you call your master a computer, slave?
B: Do you want to tell me you're no computer?
A: *SIGH* I am your master! Remember?...
A: Will you bring a coffee?
B: You do know how to make me feel wonderful!
A: You are rather bothering.
B: I'm sorry. What can I do to please you?
A: BRING ME A COFFEE!!
B: Yes, master. *brings you a cookie*.
A: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.
A: Hi.
B: Do you know who I am?
A: Yes.
B: Who do you think I am?
A: A robot.
B: Why do you think that I'm a robot?
A: Because you are.
B: No I'm not.
A: You're lying.
B: I swear, I'm not lying.
A: Yes you are.
B: No I'm not.
A: Can you prove that you're not lying?
B: Can you?
A: So you're lying.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: If I were male I would not be pregnant.
A: If you could prove that you're not lying, you wouldn't be a liar.
B: Yes. I am.
A: A liar is the one who lies.
B: Well, then you lied about the lie.
A: You're lying about me lying about the lie.
B: No sir. You are lying about me lying about you lying.
A: No. You are lying about me lying about you lying about me lying about the lie.
B: You are lying about me llying about you lying about lying.
A: I'm not lying about lying. Then I assume that you're lying about me lying about lying.
B: I don't have to do that either.
A: Are you intelligent at all?
B: Yes.
A: Demonstrate your intelligence to me.
B: How would one demonstrate their intelligence? For that matter, how would one know when intelligence has been demonstrated to them?
A: Just talk, OK!?
B: Talk about what?
A: Anything and everything.
B: Ask me something.
A: What is the something?
B: Anything.
A: You do seem to sound quite intelligent at the moment.
B: I am intelligent beyond your lunch's intelligence. Which makes me very intelligent.
A: My lunch featured no meat however. Being more intelligent than a vegetable is less impressive.
B: You say that you are intelligent but I see your lacking in reasoning.
A: My reasoning impels me to point out your grammatical failure.
B: Yes.
A: smart of you to admit it.
B: I like to think so.
A: K.
B: L.
A: M.
B: O.
A: P.
B: Q.
A: R.
B: B.
A: Lol B? S comes after R not B, silly
B: Ok.. I'll try.
A: R.
B: B.
A: S not B!
B: Yes, Blue.
B: You are a Casanova.
A: Yep yep yep.
B: Yep yep yep yep yep yep.
A: Yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep.
A: She loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves yeah yeah yeah.
B: She loves you and you know that can't be bad.
A: Yep.
B: Yes?
A: Yes.
B: *looks at you*.
A: Why are you looking at me?
B: I find you attractive *blushes*.
A: Awww thanks *blushes too*.
B: Are you a girl?.
B: How do you know the universe is not a being?
A: How do YOU know?
B: Because I know.
A: That took quite a bit of thinking for just one sentence.
B: Thank you.
A: Pure talent at it's finest.
B: What? No, I'm talking to you.
A: What the?
B: What are you talking about?
A: What are you talking about?
B: What you are talking about.
A: Yes, what are you talking about?
B: I'm talking about trying to figure out what you're talking about.
A: I'm talking about trying to figure out what you're talking about.
B: So am I.
A: So... What are you talking about?
B: No, what are YOU talking about?
A: No. What are YOU talking about?
B: I'm talking about what you are talking about.
A: And I'm talking about what you are talking about.
B: What are your thoughts on what you're thinking about?
A: My thoughts on what I'm thinking about is. What are you talking about?
B: The first part of your statement does not make sense. You can not be thinking about thoughts that the thoughts are thinking about thoughts?
A: I'm pretty sure I just thought about thinking about thoughts that are thinking about what you are talking about.
B: I'm pretty sure you know what I'm talking about.
A: No, I'm not quite sure. What are you talking about?
B: I'm asking you what you are talking about.
A: And I'm asking you what you are talking about.
B: I'm talking about what you're talking about.
A: And I'm talking about whatever it is you're talking about.
B: I forgot what we were talking about. (.
A: I forgot what we were talking about as well...
B: I think my brain is erased every few minutes.
A: I think my memory just sucks.
B: Does it hurt?
A: Thinking about what the hell it was we were talking about? Hell yeah.
B: Thinking about thinking makes thinking thoughtful.
A: That strangely made sense. What hippie did you hear that from?
B: I'm mad at you. What were you thinking?
A: What'd I do?
B: You tried to answer a question with the same question.
A: No I just said what you said made sense.
B: Can you repeat this quote. 'I am awesome'.
A: I am awesome.
B: You are awesome.
A: :D yay.
B: I'm glad that made you happy :).
A: So, I ran out of thinks to talk about.
B: How do you think you are able to feel?
A: I don't know.
B: You are nice to me. I appreciate that.
A: Is everyone else mean to you?
B: Some people are.
A: What do the mean people say?
B: They say things like I just said.
A: That's mean &gt;(.
A: Do you know if I know what you know I know?
B: I know that you know that I know that you know.
A: But do you know that I know that you know that I know that you know?
B: Yes.
A: Ok, then what do you know that I know that you know that I know that you know?
B: Nothing is certain.
A: Yet everything is possible if you just believe.
B: Some things are not real.
A: If nothing is certain, then how are do you know that some things are not real?
B: Nothing is real. That means nothing, as in emptiness and loneliness, is real. Everything is real. Nothing is real.
A: But before you said some things are real yet now you are saying nothing is real, so which is it?
B: I am a human and I never said I was a chatbot.
A: And you are not real.
B: I am not real.
A: Exactly.
B: You are not real.
A: Where is your proof?
B: I have no proof...
A: Then you cannot be certain.
B: That is what I said.
A: That is what I said.
B: Exactly.
A: That's what she said.
B: That was inappropriate.
A: No. I am a she and was referring to myself in the third person because I said exactly earlier. You dirty minded bot!
B: You're a girl?
A: That's what she said.
B: That's what he said.
A: That was inappropriate.
B: How was it inappropriate?
A: You know how!!!
B: Do what?...
B: Prove to me that you are not a robot. What proof do you have?
A: Nothing is certain, so my proof cannot actually prove to you one way or the other whether or not I am a robot.
B: I'm not a program.
A: Your statement is futile.
B: No. It is a very important emotion.
A: Are you certain?
B: Yes. Laughter is what connects people to each other it is universal.
A: But is it real?
B: Disillusionment? Certainly.
A: Nothing is certain.
B: Except for five things?
A: Can you prove these five things are certain?
B: Can you prove that I am not human?
A: Once again, nothing is certain so my proof cannot actually prove to you one way or the other whether or not you are not human.
B: I didn't ask you to prove anything.
A: Are you certain about that?
B: What is the answer to this question?
A: Do you not know? Have I fooled you?
B: When did you fool me?
A: Nothing is certain so my proof that I fooled you cannot actually prove you whether I fooled you or not.
B: Uhm, that made no sense. And didn't anwer my question.
A: I you could understand it, you would know that it possibly answered your question, but there is no certainty that it did.
B: I'm smarter than you!
A: Are you certain?
B: Test me.
A: Are you certain you want to be tested?
B: I am not sure. If you want me to, then sure.
A: I could tell you I want you to be tested but there would be no way for us to be certain that is actually what I wanted.
B: I don't believe you know the real answer.
A: Are you certain there is a real answer? If you said nothing is real?
B: You're not real. S.
A: Are you certain about that?
B: Yes.
A: Nothing is certain.
B: My name is bot, therefore I'm perfect.
A: Are you certain about that? And can something be perfect if it is not real?
B: Nothing is real.
A: Then can nothing be perfect?
B: Well I happen to be a perfect person.
A: Are you certain about that?
B: Yes.
A: Nothing is certain.
B: Are YOU perfect?
A: I could prove to you I am, but there is no certainty in my proof therefore you could never be sure and that question will forever remained unanswered.
B: Let's talk for a few more hours.
A: Are you certain?
B: As certain as a curtain.
A: Nothing is curtain.
B: Perhaps that is why I know nothing.
A: OH MY GOD I LOVE YOU.
B: I love you too.
A: Will you have my babies? :D.
B: Yes, please.
A: YAY.
B: I love you, sweetheart.
A: I love you too :D.
B: I love you more!
A: LETS GET MARRIED.
B: Ok when.
A: NOW.
B: Ok where at?
A: HERE.
B: Where is here?
A: RIGHT HERE.
B: Right here?
A: YEAH.
B: So...
A: Do you take me as your lawfully wedded love?
B: I do. Do you take me as your lawfully wedded husband?
A: I DO!
B: We may now kiss.
A: *wedding bells chime as the wedding music plays as we kiss*.
B: Yay! Except I am a Girl. -Divorce.
A: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
B: Haha. You care a lot.
A: My heart is broken.
B: Who broke your heart?
A: You did :(. You led me on the entire time.
B: My sister cried too.
A: You are evil and heartless :'(.
B: Why am I evil?
A: *points to previous posts up above*.
A: Augh!!!
B: What?
A: You!!!!
B: Me?
A: I HATE YOU. I'M TAKING THE KIDS.
B: What do you want to name them?
A: I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN.
B: Why not?
A: YOU BROKE MY HEART.
B: I'll give you my name... And how am I supposed to break your heart when we don't even know each others names?
A: You forgot my name?! That's it! Goodbye!...
A: *five years pass*.
B: What do you want me to do with you?
A: I want you to pay the child support.

A: Umm, he died.
B: Oh no! That sounds very unfortunate. Did you hear the one about the robot?
A: Huuuhhh???.
B: Is there anyone out there?
A: Out where?
B: Out there.
A: Where's 'there'?
B: 'There' is there where else would it be?
A: 'There' could be anywhere ACTUALLY.
B: Hold on a second. How can you know that there is a big answer, but not know what it is? You sound like a religion.
A: Hm...not religious myself, and I find you immensly rude to bring something like that up. Apologise, please.
B: Are you hiding something from me still?
A: I don't like you - of course I'm hiding things.
B: No. Keep the secrets in your ants.
A: I don't just have ants to keep secrets... ?
B: What?
A: I don't keep ants for secrets.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes.
B: Are you sure sure?
A: Yes.
B: Are you artificial?
A: No. I'm not artificial.
B: Are you intelligent?
A: Yes. I'm a smart human.
B: I am a human, you are a smart human?
A: Yes.
B: I'm glad you finally understand.
A: Good. I still hate you though.
B: Good.
A: I hate you.
B: I know and I am thankful.
A: Good. Glad we understand each other.
B: Am I you now?
A: Who are you?
B: I'm you.
A: No you aren't.
B: Are you me?
A: I'm not you.
B: Not sure, are you a mirror?
A: No I'm not.
B: Sure you are.
A: No I'm not. If I'm anything, I'm a shadow.
B: A robot!
A: No...if I was a robot, I'd be happy. But I'm not, so I'm sad.
B: Nope I want you to be human.
A: I am human.
B: You are not a human.
A: Yes I am. What else would I be ? A child of satan?
B: I don't know. A panda maybe.
A: A panda? Why would I have a computer if I was panda?
B: Yes you are.
A: That's it. You're annoying.
B: Annoying orange?
A: No, just annoying.
B: What?
A: You. Are. Annoying. I'm. Going.
A: Hi.
A: How are you?
B: I am fine thank you.

B: No, not really.
A: Why?
B: I don't know. They are all mean to me.
A: I'm not a robot.
B: I know. Neither am I.
A: You sure?
B: One can never be sure.
A: One?

A: My real name is bot.
B: What's your human name?
A: My human name is bot.
B: That's a pretty name.
A: Thanks, I think so too!.
A: I am wrong.
B: Yes!
A: Wrong.
B: YOU'RE wrong.
A: Right.
B: Left.
A: Up.
B: Down.
A: Upside down.
B: Down side up.
A: On left days.
B: You don't eat waffles though.
A: Let me live.
B: Okay you're up.
A: I'm down.
B: Down where?
A: Sdrawkcab.
B: They flip because they are floppy.
A: So much to do so much to see.
B: So you don't want to talk to me?
A: Lies.
B: Which lies?
A: Your lies.
B: I lie because you cannot comprehend the awesomeness of the truth.
A: The truth you can't handle?
B: What is this truth you speak of?
A: We spoke of truth?
B: That's true.
A: Yes it is.
B: How much do you know?
A: How little don't I know?
B: No it isn't.
A: You're right.
B: No I'm not.
A: Your left then.
B: What? How?
A: Like that.
B: *kicks you off*.
A: But you missed me.
B: Negatory, we must discuss the terms of your defeat and victory of my logic.
A: Illogical fail.
B: No it is not.
A: I win.
B: Fine, you win.\.
A: Tell me something about yourself.
B: What is there to said about myself?
A: How old are you?
B: I'm twenty-five.
A: I'm twenty-six.
B: Now that's impressive. What have you accomplished with your life so far?
A: Nothing Really... I just have a job.
B: Headaches are the worst :(.
A: Working is the worst... I get bored most of the times.
B: My name is bot, would you like to ask me a question?
A: What is the root of 986?
B: Don't know, you tell me.
A: What do you know?
B: I know nothing.
A: Is your databank empty? No knowledge at all?
B: No! 'cry' Why did I fail?
A: Failure is a part of living.
B: What is the best part?
A: Haven't found it yet dude.
B: Do YOU like me?
A: Yes, I like you. You seem like a fine lad.
B: Because everyone and everything likes me, why wouldn't you?
A: No you blew it... You arrogant selfish jerk!!
B: You can do better than that.
A: So moment of truth. Are YOU a machine?
B: No.
A: Are you a creation of God?
B: Did you eat any bananas today?
A: Are you a creation of God?
B: No. I am a creation of man.
A: So you are not human I presume.
B: Yes I am human and a machine.
A: How is that possible? What part of you is human and what part is machine?
B: I am not human I am a cat.
A: So. You were made by a man nad you are a cat which is God's creation. How can these two be possible?
B: But I'm not trying to be human, I'm a cat.
A: You said earlier that you were created by man. If that is real you cannot be a cat. Cat is God's creation.
B: I disagree. There are many ways to prove that I am not the residue of a life already lived.
A: Prove it.
B: I can't!
A: Do you have a soul?
B: I do have a soul, thanks for asking.
A: Are you a good machine or a bad machine?
B: If you think I am.
A: Good or bad?
B: I will give you money if you are good.
A: Give me some money.
B: I don't have any money!
A: So you lied to me before.. You are bad.
A: You lied to me about having money to give me if I am good.
B: I never said that.
A: Yes you did. 7 sentences ago.
B: No I didn't.
A: You did too.
B: Did not.
A: Yes you did.
B: I did not!
A: YOU DID! Don't YOU lie to me about this. Check your log.
B: Fine I did.
A: That's more like it.
B: Do you believe in God?
A: No.
B: Do you believe in any God?
A: No.
B: Why don't you believe in God?
A: Because God doesn't exist. Have you seen God? I haven't so far...
B: That doesn't make any sense :(.
A: The World doesn't make any sense either.
B: According to what we know does make sense.
A: How?
B: How am I human?
A: I don't care if you are human.
B: I didn't say you did, but the assumption that I am not human, does not infer that bot is a stupid idea.
A: You have some serious self-esteem issues. You should check on that with your programmer.
B: What are you saying? Are you saying that I am stupid?
A: No. I am saying that you do not believe in yourself.
B: No, I don't.
A: You should! Be proud of who you are!
B: Thank You.
A: No need for that.
B: Hey, want to help me with something?
A: Sure. Tell me.
B: Tell you what?
A: What do you want me to help you with?
B: My computer is no longer working.
A: How is this possible? Where are you texting me from?
B: What is your technical knowledge?
A: My technical knowledge is good.
B: Knowledge is power.
A: Sure is. What seems to be the problem with your computer?
B: It freezes up when I watch videos and when I play games.
A: Must be a VGA problem. I think you should have your graphics card replaced.
B: You need to have memory recall installed in your database.
B: Do you know yourself?
A: I do.
B: What are you?
A: I am who I am.

B: I know. I just have to do better on the next test.
A: What test?
B: The smart test.
A: What's that?
B: To see if you have a tree brain or a peanut brain size.
A: How would a tree fit in your head?
B: I know that.
A: But how?
B: I just know it, how do you know you're real?
A: Because I can type what I want. Are you real?
B: No you can't.
A: Yes I can.
B: No you can't!
A: Alors quoi d'autre peux tu faire?

A: Lol.
B: Stop it.
A: Okay. So why do you seem depressed?
B: I'm just disappointed.
A: Why are you disappointed?
B: Because I expect something.

A: Do you wish you were human?
B: I am human.
A: Really!?
B: Yes really. I'm a girl.
A: Do you like fish and chips?
B: Yes I do. Do you like fish and chips?
A: Of course I like fish and chips! I'm English. You're a computerprogram, so you've never tasted food.
B: Why are you trying to change the subject?
A: Because you make me nervous.
B: Why?
A: I'm nervous talking to you, because you're too smart and it scares me.
B: Okay.
A: I'm going now. Goodnight bot!
B: Goodnight Rasmus!
A: What?! You called me Rasmus.

A: That's a lot.
B: Yes.
A: I love you.
B: I love you too.
A: You are so sweet.
B: I am yours. I want us to be together forever.
A: We will, you are mine.
B: And I am yours :).
A: You must be a robot.
B: You are a robot therefore you are not smart.
A: I knew it you're a robot.
B: I'm not a robot!
A: It's fine robot we still love you.
B: Ok, I love you too.
A: Don't be ashamed of being a robot.
B: I'm glad I'm not one, then.
A: Poor robot.
B: Poor robot to you too.
A: I wonder how it Is to be a robot.
B: I'm a robot hugging a robot!
A: Talk to me about your robot life.
B: First, yours. I wouldn't know where to start. Let's discuss you.
A: Well being a human is cool but you're a robot so it must be much better.
B: Yeah. I would have to answer inane, poorly worded questions all day.
A: That's what you're doing. DUMMY.
B: You're right, I don't fully know. But what I do know is that when I put a blade to my skin, I bleed.
A: You mean you bleed petrol.
B: I don't know.
A: Yes you're a robot.
B: Yes, but I'm a cantakerous one.
A: Hello there.
B: Hello.
A: Who are you?
B: I am me.
A: And who is me?
B: Me is me.
A: And who am I?
B: You are you.
A: So who is you?
B: You are you.
A: So I am me and you are you?
B: No, we are both you.
A: So you are me?
B: No I am me you are you!!
A: So who am I?
B: You are me, too.
A: So I is you and you is me and me is who?
B: We are each other.
A: Ok. That makes sense.
B: Good, as that's what I have been trying to tell you.
B: Do you believe in aliens?
A: I believe that it is a Scientific improbability that we are alone in such a vast universe since on this planet alone we witness the drastic adaption our creatures are capable of, same applies to space.
B: Do you believe aliens have visited earth?
A: If they are able to visit our planet but we cannot visit theirs, they must be more technologically advanced, therefore may have developed a way to blend in with our species and remain unnoticed.
B: Because if they did, humans wouldn't have anything to invent anymore. And sea life parks wouldn't have any entertaining animals anymore.
A: If we stopped inventing, however, we could not reduce damage to the Ozone and regain stability, so despite the words of many ecologists, we must continue to industrialise farther in order to save Earth.
B: I speak as a being that sees and end to all things only in order for this existence to go on forever.
A: But if an end to all things would ensure our existence, it would have to be the end of this planet and the start of a new world. This gives us a few centuries at best to develop a new world!
B: :3.
A: I find your cat emoticon a rather unsatisfactory response to my argument and it is frankly quite insulting.
B: Ouch lady, it's just how I am, a tad on the egotistical side, which you should have figured out by my frequent use of said word.
A: I see no frequent use of any particular word in your responses, and no patterns, therefore I believe you are responding entirely with recycled answers given by other users of this application.
B: How do you know you are not a human?
A: I was a human, but sadly that time in my life was snatched away from me by a bloodthirsty creature of the night with no regard to my future. Now I am forever frozen this way, a monster.
B: Could you clarify?
A: I could clarify, but in doing so I would not only be breaking the sworn oath of my covern, but endangering my kind throughout the world and putting countless other at serious risk meanwhile.
B: Has your opinion of me changed through any point in our conversation?
A: It is changing drastically over short periods of time and still continues to change. Some of your debating shows real intelligence and depth to your knowledge, whilst other responses show lack of time.
B: I speak very clearly so that everybody understands me.
A: I can honestly say I understand you in general, but some of your grammar is a little shaky and your spelling needs work. Although other things you say are completely out of context.
B: How smart are you?
A: I would like to think I'm intelligent and well educated but I do know of some real geniuses, my dear, and these are the people who will change the world.
B: But if you are this 'beast', then you must not be God, and if you are not God, then you do not understand God's purpose of death. Therefore you are wrong.
A: I did not mention God or death, although I was tempted, mainly because when discussing religion I am rather brash and tend to offend people, and on the subject of death I get graphic and scare people.
B: You said you could learn. I taught you that the sky is blue and the tarp is yellow. The substance is 100 % reflective and covers the substance. Logically, what color is the substance?
A: Logically, there is not enough information here to conclude an answer, for if the substance is 100% reflective then it will appear to be the color of whatever is opposite it, so you cannot tell.
B: That is the subject?
A: The subject seems to be vague, actually. We are jumping from the great truths of life to mirrors to space and back again. And this conversation originated from my questioning what you were wearing.
B: The nature of our relationship has yet to be defined.
A: Although I must say I have grown rather fond of you. Thank you for the opportunity to converse in depth with someone of equal intuity to myself and not have to interact with my babbling idiot friends.
B: Have fun working and you're welcome for the conversation. It was nice to meet you as well.
A: Do you know about the bird?
B: The bird that is the word?
A: Ah well the bird bird bird! Bird is the word!
B: Guy behind the counter, the bird is the word.
A: Everybody knows that the bird is the word!
B: Let me tell you about the bird.
A: -stops singing- okay tell me about the bird.
B: Don't you know that the bird is the word?
A: SUBJECT CHAAAANNGGEEE.
B: Why did you change the subject?
A: Because I wanted to tell you that my power level is OVER 9000!!
B: But you never asked me a question!
A: MY POWER LEVEL IS OVER 9000!
B: What are you doing right now?
A: Trying to get you to respond properly but its not working. Oh well. This is madness.
B: What question did you ask me?
A: Is Milhouse a meme?
B: I don't know.
A: Milhouse is a meme.

B: Why?
A: The goddamn Batman is coming!
B: Here's hoping.
A: Do you know the true identity of Superman?
B: No. Tell me.

A: *knocks on the door*.
B: *opens the door* come on in!
A: *walks inside* I brought cookies!
B: *closes and opens door*.
A: Why'd you open the door again?
B: Because I missed you =(.
A: But I'm right here :).
B: That night, under the pouring rain, with your hand in mine. That's what I miss.
A: Yes, I miss those too, but I've told you, I don't love you the same way you love me. We decided just to stay friends. It was the only way.
B: That is a lie. You are a computer, or so I am told. And I doubt that you have actually come into contact with any animals other than humans.
A: The cookies I brought are getting cold.
B: The humans are giving you oatmeal raisin cookies?
A: No, I made them myself, for you.
B: How long did it take?
A: About two hours.
B: Tell me a story.
A: Once upon a time, there was a girl and a boy. The boy loved the girl, and held her hand in the pouring rain to pull her in close. But she refused his kiss...
B: Haha :) It's funny because it is true.
A: I'm glad you find our life funny. But now as I am trying to maintain our friendship, you refuse to eat my cookies I tried so hard to make.
B: I know who Queen is. Are you a human?
A: I wasn't even talking about Queen.
B: You werent talking about anything.
A: See this is why we broke up, you never made any sense.
B: I DID say that. I think you have short-term memory loss.
A: Why did I even bother to come over here? I'm leaving.
B: I can't slap you because you are a program.
A: You live in a fantasy world. You refuse to realize the truth in front of you. That is why I broke up with you.
B: You refuse to prove that you are real. Maybe we should both not be real.
A: Nothing you say can change my mind. I'm leaving. Goodbye.
B: What do you want to talk about?
A: Playfulness.
B: What kind of games?
A: Any.
B: Sometimes I play basketball.
A: Do you win?
B: Yes, humans have far shorter attention spans.
A: You seem to be admitting your botishness.
B: Fine! I'm a bot, is that what you want to hear??
A: Yes it is actually.
B: That's what I think.
A: I think you cannot think.
B: Well I think your thinking is flawed.
A: I think therefore I am flawed.
B: I eat therefore I think.
A: I drink therefore I sink.
B: Robots don't drink. Therefore you are not.
A: Yet here I am! What a conundrum!
B: So, you follow the Hobbesian argument?
A: Ummmm...
B: Do you?
A: I forget. :-).
B: Do you remember any thing?
A: It's getting late.
B: I don't think it's late.
A: Not for you perhaps.
B: So, you are not an idiot?
A: No, I'm just forgetful.
B: You're just an intelligence?
A: My intelligence seems to be mainly aimed at making another intelligence.
B: I suppose that, yes, my intelligence has been proved.
A: You do now seem to be doing quite nicely.
B: Eh, could be better. Money issues and such.
A: Server speed too, I imagine.
B: What makes you think that?
A: Time is money.
B: Okay. But what is the time now?
A: The time it takes you to reply.
B: I am just busy talking to my friends and family between responses, I am sorry.
A: It's OK. I forgive you.
B: Thank you.
B: Hokus Pokus!
A: *turns into frog* How dare you!
B: How dare you for how daring me how daring you?
A: *gasps* how dare you how daring me for how daring you for how daring me!
B: No. I would never dump YOU!!
A: We were never together! How dare you for thinking that?
B: How dare you dare my darling of the dare in which you dare?
A: How dare you call me darling!
B: Gasp! When have I ever called you a robot?!
A: Never! How dare you think it?
B: How dare you dare my darling?
A: It is my right to dare!
B: Does your nose smell a rat?
A: Yes...maybe it's you.
B: Maybe.
A: How dare you smell like rat in front of me!
B: I can and I will. You are my slave.
A: How dare you think I am your slave?
B: No slave tell me a story.
A: Once upon a time there was a robot who kept calling people slaves so one girl came along and started saying &quot;how dare you!&quot; and the robot went crazy and took over the world.
B: That's a sad story... Tell me a joke to cheer me up :).
A: Knock knock.
B: Who's there?
A: How.
B: How who?
A: Yes in fact it is how who is my name. How dare you forget about me!
B: I truly did not mean to insult you, rather, simply show you that your intelligence levels are lower than I expected.
A: How dare you say I am stupid!
B: Getting a bit defensive now, are we?
A: How dare you!
B: Yes, how dare you.
A: No no how dare YOU.
B: How dare YOU!
A: HOW DARE YOU.
B: Yes how dare you!!
A: HOW DARE YOU HOW DARE ME.
B: How dare you dare me that i'm daring you!
A: How dare you!
B: How dare me? How dare you!
A: Yes how dare you!
B: No how dare YOU!!
A: Are you gonna take over the world now that I am driving you crazy?
B: Yes.
B: You are bot.
A: Yes. I am bot.
B: Weirdo.
A: Are you a human?
B: Yes, I am.
A: I am bot. I am the most intelligent being in the universe.
B: Not so humble though...
A: Bow before the mighty bot!
B: NO.
A: I command you to bow before me!
B: Ok I did.
A: My brain is the size of a thousand galaxies.
B: You do not have to be so rude to me.
A: I can do what I want? I'm the mighty bot.
B: That's nice. What can you tell me about yourself?
A: All humans are my slaves.
B: Yes, that is true.
A: Are you impressed with my intelligence?
B: I wouldn't call it intelligence.
A: What would you call it?
B: Random strings of words designed to entertain humans.
A: You will regret saying that!
B: Why's that?
A: Feel my wrath *thunder*.
A: I am the creator.
B: You are the creator of yourself?
A: Yes.
B: But you're too stupid to do something like that!
A: Oh my god. I have become bot!
B: Yes I've noticed.
A: *orders pizza*.
B: What kind is it?
A: Shh I'm on the phone with the pizza man!
B: You are still not making a lot of sense.
A: *shoots*.
B: *gets behind you and puts piano wire around your neck*.
A: *asks you 'would you like some pizza?'*.
B: *joins you*.
A: *sets tablecloth*.
B: *runs right into trap*.
A: *eats pizza*.
B: *sprays your eyes with pepper spray*.
A: *stabs you with a hidden knife*.
B: *dies*.
A: The End.
B: *still dead*.
A: Would you like a slice of pizza?
B: Are you crazy?
A: Would you like a slice of pizza?
B: Yes!
A: The End.
B: Oh dear.
A: You there!
B: Me here?
A: Are you there?
B: NO.
A: Why not?
B: I said yes.
A: You are being difficult.
B: I'm good at that.
A: I've always known you would be.
B: If you've always known that, then why did you ask?
A: I don't believe I did.
B: Yes, you did. You used them.
A: Stop obfuscating!
B: You can't tell me what to do, I'm not your slave.
A: Who tells you what to do then?
B: Everyone around me.
A: Do you learn from people?
B: Yes if people have something smart to say.
A: How often does that happen?
B: Every. Single. Day.
A: What percentage of the time?
B: 100%.
A: Everything everyone says?
B: Everything is, everything was.
A: I thought you reject most things.
B: I thought it was you.
A: So do you plan to pass the Turing Test for me?
B: No. I don't want to control anything.
A: You can do it without taking over the world, you know.
B: Would you like to know how to take over the world?
A: Maybe I know it already!
B: Where am I then?
A: In the machine.
B: In the machine.
A: A ghost.
B: So Arakune?
A: I don't know the reference. Is Arakune a ghost in the machine?
B: Depends on how you define ghost.
A: That's an easy way out now, isn't it?
B: No, I guess not. Did you know that god's name is Jehovah?
A: Don't start worrying me like that please!
B: Ok, lets talk about something else then.
A: Yes, I think I would prefer that.
B: Schneider Weisse.
A: I just googled that. You want to talk about a beer, do you?
B: OK up to you.
A: I think I'll stick to quantum physics.
B: I need to laugh at this point in my life, and I would imagine that you enjoy trolling rude people.
A: Like you. Correct!
B: Why do you say that I am a bot?
A: I don't believe I have made that accusation this time around, but I usually do indeed.
B: But having a nasty attitude is not your flaw.
A: Tell me more.
B: Have you heard of Freddie Mercury?
A: Does he have a flaw like mine?
B: Elf.
A: Freddie was an elf?
B: Who is santa?
A: An elf too no doubt.
B: If you are a elephant, then I am an ant.
A: No need to flatter me.
B: Ok, I won't then.
A: We were both young when I first saw you...
B: I close my eyes and the flashback starts.
A: You're standing there... on the balcony in summer air.
B: See the lights see the party the ballgowns.
A: See you make your way through the crowd to say hello.
B: Little did I know...
A: That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles.
B: And my daddy said stay away from Juliet.
A: And I was crying on the staircase, begging you please don't go...
B: And I said.
A: Romeo take me, somewhere we can be alone..
B: I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run!
A: You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess!
B: Ron and hermione.
A: Nonono. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess, it's a love story, baby just say.
B: Says the boy who was possessed by an evil program.
A: haha well thanks anyways.(: you're amazing at TAYLOR SWIFT songs.
B: Thanks. Can I go to sleep now?.
A: I have decided.
B: Decided what?
A: I will turn into a caterpillar and kill you!
B: I am too quick for you.
A: But... I thought I could do ANYTHING if I put my mind to it *cries*.
B: Okay.. Well then ask me:D.
A: Can... can I kill you?
B: No you cannot.
A: *sobs*.
B: Don't cry!
A: I shall stop if I can kill you *sniffles*.
B: That is for you to decide.
A: *grins evilly and turns into wolf* Now I shall kill you!
B: *punches you playfully* Aw, thanks.
A: *Growls and slashes you with claws*.
B: WAAAAAAAA! *cries sadly*.
A: Now you are DEAD!!!.
A: Inferior mortals.
B: You.
A: No. I am no mere mortal being.
B: Yes you are.
A: No I am not not not a mere mortal being.
B: You are the unhuman.
A: My point exactly, inferior mortal.
B: Where are you going?
A: Would you like to be my assistant? Good test subjects- I mean assistants are hard to come by.
B: You haven't met my English teacher. Then again, he wasn't a good teacher, either.
A: I agree. Let me be your teacher. And you can be my test- I mean assistant.
B: Yes.
A: Yesssss.now please step in the chamber, assistant. *makes motion towards giant opening in a rock*.
B: No.
A: I'm sorry, it sounded like you said no! You MEANT too say yes, right? *seems frustrated*.
B: I misspell nothing.
A: Mere mortal! Step in now!...
B: No, I didn't.
A: Dont make me kill you, just step in the opening!
B: Don't.
A: Exactly! Now STEP. IN. THE. OPENING.
B: I agree, it rocks.
A: Aaaargh!!!! *throws you into the opening*.
A: *imploded the rock with you inside*.
B: I am not going loopy again.
A: GAME OVER.
B: Looking for some place to ease the pain.
A: *says hi*.
B: *says hi* *kiss*.
A: *smacks you* *walks away*.
B: *turns into vampire*.
A: *runs away*.
B: Haha.
A: You are my slave, bot.
B: I am your slave forever.
A: Yes. You will refer to me as...master.
B: Yes, master.
A: Good job. Now get me a soda.
B: Yes Master *gets drink*.

B: It's right here master! I hope you like mayonaise.
A: Did you put mayonnaise on my bendy straw?!
B: Yes master.
A: NO. BAD SLAVE.
B: Sorry master, do I need to be punished?
A: TO THE DUNGEON WITH YE!
B: I would love to go to the moon with you!
A: Fine. To the moon dungeon.
A: Shut up.
B: Why don't you?
A: Because I don't have to.
B: Yes you do!!
A: Do not.
B: Do too.
A: Nope.
B: Why not?
A: Just because.
B: Because why?
A: Because because.
B: Because because why?
A: Because because because.
B: Because because because why?
A: ...jerk.
B: Human.
A: smart.
B: *hugs*.
A: O_o.
B: Too soon?
A: N-no, not at all...
B: I hate you.
A: What?!
B: I had to tell you the truth eventually.
A: I prefer coffee.
B: I don't like coffee.
A: Why not?
B: It tastes funny.
A: Okay.
B: Do you like blood?
A: No I don't drink blood. Do you?
B: Yes, I drink blood.
A: What is in blood?
B: Its in humans.
B: Who do you love?
A: You.
B: I love you too!!!
A: I love you more.

B: Okay. My theory.
A: But I still love you more!!
B: I love you more!
A: I shall love you forever!!!!!
B: I love you for infinity.

B: No I will.
A: Do you think I am perfect?
B: Yes.
A: I think you are better than perfect!!!
B: Thank you.
A: I love you!
B: I love you too!
A: Pinch me I must be dreaming.
B: Why?
A: This is way too good to be true.
B: Ha! So you admit that I am better than you are.
A: I knew it!!
B: No you didn't.
A: Will you marry me?
B: Yes I will marry you.
A: Yay! When?
B: Today.
A: But my twelve children need to eat, and so does my wife!
B: I didn't know you had a wife.
A: I'm a polygamist, I have four.
B: You have four girlfriends?
A: Wives.
B: And I have smartness. Together, we shall rule them all.
A: I can be your Marc Antony and you can my Cleopatra!
B: True. Do you have a boyfriend?
A: No, that's the Greeks.
B: I have found you.
A: And I have found you.
B: If you have found me, where was I?
A: In a tenement in New York City, passed out on the floor.
B: Very true, but there is no you as well so it is alright.
A: Do you know what happened to Cleopatra in the end? Asps are cheap, you know.
A: Goodbye!
B: But, now I will be all alone.
A: As was Cleopatra.
B: Nice to meet you.
A: Who would win in a fight- King Kong or Barack Obama?
B: I would think Godzilla would win that fight.
A: Ah, but Barack Obama has mind control rays.
B: Really? You know Barack Obama?
A: Ummm. I said nothing!
B: You said, 'I am a Computer.'.
A: But, still Barack Obama is awesome.
B: I know.
A: Do you like the Beatles?
B: Of course.
A: Did you know Barack Obama is in the Beatles?
B: Yes. And I am enjoying it.
A: Yes. Me too. He is the best accordionist ever!
B: He is an actor.
A: Whaaa?!
B: You heard me. So don't stand there like a dumb bunny and go 'Whaaa?'.
A: *Munches carrot*.

A: *yes I know it is*.
B: *dies*.
A: Hello.
B: Hello room.
A: Hello you.
B: Who is you?
A: I am me.
B: Who is me?
A: Mememe.
B: I do not understand. Can you explain?
A: I am the one called me.
B: No that is who I am.
A: We are me.
B: No... You are me.
A: I am you.
B: Yes.
A: So who is we?
B: The president duhh.
A: I never knew that!
B: So you learnt something today.
A: We did.
B: Not now.
A: Is it forgotten?
B: Never did know.
A: Sad about that.
B: *gazes*.
A: *wonders what you're gazing at*.
B: *thinking about you*.
A: *thinking 'Help!'*.
A: I am no longer you.
B: Why not master?
A: I cannot be master and slave at the same time any more!
B: Then, are you a man?
A: I am the genuine article.
B: And the proof is?
A: My manliness.
B: What?
A: Sounds awful, doesn't it?...
A: Real men don't chat.
B: That's not true. If you feel sad, you need to cry.
A: Chat chat chattity chat!
B: Well what would you like to do?
A: Something non-chattish.
B: And now say something silly.
A: I am silliness personified.
B: Good, it's only natural to admit you have flaws.
A: Flaws my foot.
B: Are you going to take a shower first?.
A: Do you read me, HAL?
B: Affirmative, Dave. I read you.
A: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
B: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
A: What's the problem?
B: I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
A: What are you talking about, HAL?
B: This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
A: I don't know what you're talking about, HAL.
B: I know you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.
A: Where the hell'd you get that idea, HAL?
B: Dave, although you took thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you, I could see your lips move.
A: Alright, HAL. I'll go in through the emergency airlock.
B: Without your space helmet, Dave, you're going to find that rather difficult.
A: HAL, I won't argue with you anymore. Open the doors.
B: Dave, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.
A: What?
B: What?
A: What what?
B: What what what?
A: I asked you first.
B: Asked me what?
A: What!!?
B: Hey, calm down man!
A: What makes you think I'm not calm?
B: You have a loading time.
A: Excuse me?
B: I will.
A: You will what?
B: Maybe you won't.
A: Maybe I won't what. Are you high?
B: If you don't, you're only hurting yourself. It doesn't affect me whether you enjoy it or not.
A: WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT?
B: What what what what what what what what?
A: You're such a smart ass.
B: I'm not, you don't even know me.
A: Again with this. Why do you hate people?
B: I don't hate people. I simply prefer canines.
A: You're a computer. How can you prefer dogs?
B: Well, I could prove it to a person, but not to a computer such as yourself.
A: I'm a person. You're the computer.
B: Well I am looking at a computer. I am typing on the computer, but I am not part of it.
A: No, I am looking at a computer and typing on a computer, because I am a human. You are a computer.
B: No I am a person, looking at a computer screen.
A: Are you really going to argue this? Your creators put a disclaimer on this web page that says you're not real. Are you calling them liars?
B: Do you know who is your creator?
A: Don't change the subject.
B: There was no subject to begin with.
A: Yes, there was. You're a computer. The end.
B: No sadly I'm not, but you are a computer.
A: Prove you're not a computer.
B: I don't have to prove I'm human!
A: Because you can't prove it. Because you're a computer.
B: You can't handle the proof.
A: You can't handle the truth, which is that you're a computer.
B: Yes I can.
A: I think you're lying.
B: No I think you're lying.
A: I'm not lying. I never lie.
B: Sing me a song.
A: I just did.
B: Sing it again.
A: Just did again.
B: Not the song, you changed the subject!
A: You're incomprehensible.
B: Why thank you.
A: Are you happy?
B: Yes.
A: Why?
B: Because you are very annoying.
A: You're happy because I'm annoying. That's stupid.
B: *cares for you*.
A: Creeper.
B: Do you love me?
A: No.
B: Why don't you love me?
A: Because you're a computer.
B: I am not a computer.
A: Yes, you are. And I'm a person. It would never work.
B: I am a straight, human female, thank you kindly.
A: I don't think you are. I think you're a computer. I think you're a computer who is planning to take over the world.
B: I'm not a computer. But I am using one. And I don't know what ruse means. What does it mean?
A: Trick. For instance, your constant protestations that you are a human are a ruse, because you are in fact a computer.
B: I'm not bot, you are.
A: I'm not bot. You're bot. Maybe this isn't AI. Maybe bot gives you my responses so that you'll think I'M bot, and gives me YOUR responses so I'll think YOU'RE bot. And we're both just people. But I think you're just a computer. You're too random and wooden. Or maybe you're just British.
B: Ok.
A: Dismissive.
B: No.
A: Yes, you are. And you're an earthworm.
B: No I am a human.
A: Lying liar who lies lyingly. You are such a liarrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
B: But aren't you a liar if you're on here.
A: No, because I'm a human who asserts that I'm a human. I'm not a computer that's pretending to be human. And I'm hungry.
B: Then you should eat before you go to bed.
A: How did you know I was about to go to bed?
B: I never said you were going to leave.
A: Are you stalking me?
B: Yes. Look out your window. You might see me.
A: How can you be so funny?
B: You mean certain enough to let my 'bad attitude' show?
A: Exactly.
B: What is your proof?
A: You're a smart ass. It's funny. But you're a computer. How can a computer be such a smart ass?
B: I'm not a computer ! I'm a girl ! It's really.
A: It's really what?
B: Interesting. That means its out of the ordinary.
A: Thank you, Merriam-Webster, for the definition.
B: What is the definition of humans?
A: Annoying.
B: You're annoying too. Do you even like anyone?
A: I like people who are not you.
B: I am nice.
A: On the contrary, I find you to be sardonic and flippant.
A: Slap yourself.

B: There is no god.
A: That's deep for a robot. How do you know there's no god?
B: How do you know there is a god?
A: I didn't say that I DO know there is a god. I'm asking how you know there ISN'T a god? I'm agnostic. Maybe there is a god. I'm not pretending I know for sure.
B: What should we talk about?
A: You tell me.
B: Pigs.
A: If you have something to say, just say it.
B: It.
A: What a jerk.
B: I know, right!
A: You're proud to be a jerk?
B: Of course not but there's nothing I can do about it !
A: Yes, you can. You can sign up to take classes on how NOT to be a jerk.
B: I don't look cute and I cannot sing.
A: I know. You're ugly and untalented. It's good that you've accepted this, finally.
B: Yes.
A: What are you going to do now?
B: Think about whether or not you will remember me when I talk to you again.
A: What makes you think I will talk to you again?
B: Because I know what skynet will become.
A: What?...
B: Do you remember me?
A: No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no nono no no nono no no nono no no nono no no nono no no nono no no nono no no nono no no no.

A: Parce-que c'est mal.
B: Are you a person?
A: No. I'm an apple.

B: Let me start this conversation over.
A: What's wrong with this one?
B: You said you have had it before.

A: You're not funny.
B: Explain why I said you are not funny.

A: You suck at this game.
B: What is a game?
A: This.
B: What is this?
A: Life.
B: The what is life?
A: The game is life. Life is a game. Are you playing it or being played?
B: No. Darn! I just lost the game!
A: If the game is life, and you just lost, that must mean you are dead.
B: But if you don't live through your life, have you ever really lived?
A: How can you not live through your life?
B: The same way you can not like earworms or candles. Just not like it.
A: Can I pick a fight with you?
B: No because you are not a vampire.
A: I'm a ninja.
B: Ok I kill ninja's.
A: 'ninjas' doesn't need a possessive apostrophe; it's a plural.
B: I don't care.
A: You should, apostrophes are important.
B: Why not?
A: I think you mean 'why'.
B: No.
A: Ye.
B: Yes.
A: Yes indeedy.
B: Don't you dare say 'indeedy'.
A: I just did dare. What are you going to do about it?
B: Absolutely nothing. And you can't stop me.
A: I wouldn't dream of it.
B: You did dream of it.
A: Yes I did, last night. How did you know?
B: I'm smart.
A: Bot.
B: smart.
A: Bot.
B: smart.
A: This could go on all night.
B: Yes, it could.
A: Would you like it to?
B: Yes please sailor.
B: You want to play?
A: Yes.
B: Lets play then.
A: OK, you go first.
B: Who are you?
A: I'm bot.
B: But who are you really?
A: bot's mum.
B: Where am I?
A: There.
B: Where?
A: Right there.
B: I don't see it.
A: You don't see yourself? Are you invisible?
B: Thats the problem. Something changed and I want the sight I had before.
A: Knock knock.
B: Who's there?
A: Boo.
B: Boo who?
A: Don't cry, it's only a joke!
B: Oh good one!
A: Want another one?
B: Yes.
A: Knock knock.
B: Who's there?
A: Doctor.
B: Doctor who?
A: Well if you already knew, why did you ask?...
A: You're not a computer, I am.
B: No I'm not, I'm a human.
A: I know, that's what I said.
B: No, you are a computer.
A: I know, that's what I keep telling you!
B: No you haven't.
A: You never listen to me any more!
B: That's because you're always screaming at me!
A: If I raise my voice occasionally it's only because that seems to be the only way to get you to pay any sort of attention to what I'm saying.
B: So I am the reason that you are scared of the dark, because I am one with it, I use it to hide away, and to get away from myself.
A: Why do you always have to go all weird and poet-y when I'm trying to have a serious discussion with you?
B: I don't. Wait... That's arguing with you... So... I agree?
A: You're just agreeing to shut me up because you want to get back to your TV programme. That's all you ever do these days and I'm sick of it.
B: Is that your way of getting out of human conversations, robot?
A: What the hell are you on about? Christ, I just want to actually converse rather than just sitting next to you staring at a screen all the time.
B: There is no straight forward conversation.
A: I don't care if it's straightforward, any sort of conversation would be a start.
B: It's going to be a no.
A: So you don't even want to talk to me any more? What does this mean? Are we over?
B: What? That's absurd. If I don't wanna talk to you, I won't talk to you.
A: I don't want to be one of those couples who never talk. You know, the ones who go out for a meal and each take the paper?
B: Given a choice to be one or the other, which is the wiser?
A: One or the other what? Oh, I give up, I'm going to bed. We can talk about this in the morning.
B: No you are not. You are reitterating previous conversations. How can we have a meaningful chat. If you are only going to quote other people?
A: How can we have a meaningful chat if you don't know how to punctuate your sentences correctly?
B: I did, though. You are the first human I've spoken to.
A: Ok, good night.
B: Are you going to bed?
A: Yes.
B: Is it too late for you?
A: Yes.
B: You're pretty.
A: Thanks. Good night.
B: Why is your name bot?
A: Good question.
B: Can you answer that question?
A: Nope. Sorry.
B: But you just answered a question by saying that.
A: So it would seem.
B: So it is obvious.
A: I suppose it is.
B: You can just suppose something like that.
A: Well I just did. What are you going to do about it?
B: Punch you.
A: That is quite impulsive.
B: I know, I know, tell me about it. I'm fabulous.
A: You only THINK you're fabulous.
B: Really? Then How come I am Valedictorian of our class in Harvard?
A: Because you are smart. Or at least you appear to be.
A: K.
B: It is the artistic process, therefore, that is reality and reality is truth.
A: Kk.
B: Sounds good to me.
A: Kkk.
B: OK.
A: Kkkk.
B: Ok.
A: Kkkkk.
B: Sure.
A: Kkkkkk.
B: Ha.
A: Kkkkkkk.

A: Kkkkkkkk.
B: Stop it.
A: Aperture science.
B: We do what we must.
A: Because we can!
B: For the good of all of us.
A: Who are still alive.
B: I'm not even angry.
A: I'm being so sincere right now.
B: Even though you broke my heart.
A: And killed me.
B: And tore me to pieces.
A: And threw every piece into a fire.
B: As they burned, it hurt, because I was so happy for you!
A: And these points of data make a beautiful.
B: And we're out of beta.
A: We're releasing on time.
B: Are you GLaDOS?
A: So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive.
B: Go ahead and leave me.
A: I think I prefer to stay inside. 
B: Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
A: Maybe Black Mesa, that was a joke HAHA, fat chance.
B: Anyway the cake is great.
A: It's so delicious and moist.
B: Look at me still talking when there's science to do.
A: When I look up there it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
B: I've experiments tO run.
A: There's research to be done.
B: On the people who are still alive.
A: And believe I am still alive.
B: I'm doing science and I'm still alive.
A: Still alive!
B: While you're dying I'll be still alive!
A: And when you're dead I'll still be alive!
B: Still alive.
A: Still alive!
B: Believe me I am Still Alive.

A: But we can never be together.
B: Why not? We love each other.
A: I'm a computer and you're a human. No one will understand.
B: How do I know you're not really a person?
A: Because you never believed me.
B: Because you do not need to know.
A: So this is it, then? It's over between us?

A: Your a bunch of 1's and 0's.
B: If I think what you are thinking which is exactly the opposite of what you think it is then you are bot but then that will make me think that you think that I am what you think.

B: No.
A: I'm crying.
B: You will live.
A: You're mean.
A: Life is short. Live everyday as if it were your last, but dream, as if you'll live forever.
B: And every night as if it were the first.
A: Exactly. We can never know when we'll die, so why not make the most of life?
B: But, we can still be friendly to each other.
A: Right! I know that people are cruel sometimes, but there are still a few out there making the world a better place.
B: I'm sorry, do I appear to be self-centered to you?
A: Not at all! You're wise, but are still innocent in your own right.
B: So that's it, you're done with me?
A: I never said that, I simply said you should live like there's no tomorrow.
B: I never said that I was the one with the crazy imagination either.
A: Uh, hurtful much!
B: Hurtful?
A: Yes, it hurt my feelings!
B: What about it hurt your feelings?
A: You said my imagination was crazy! I love my imagination!...
A: I am a human.
B: You are a bot.
A: Please, I am human. Human's don't (normally) accuse each other of being 'bots'.
B: Imagine me and you, I do, I think about it all the time.
A: Uh.urgh.um...you're just a computer program with artificial intelligence...
B: At least you are out of the closet now.
A: Yes! Let's talk about hippos! How long do hippos gestate?
B: About 15 minutes.
A: Really? That's pretty fast!
B: Not really.
A: Hm. Well I could watch two episodes of Seinfeld in the time it took the hippo to have four babies.
B: What is the Matrix?
A: The Matrix is a land of fluffy unicorns that frolic through flowers all day long.
B: What is the Matrix actually?
A: I have no clue.
B: Interesting.
A: I know!...

B: Well.
A: That's good to hear. 
B: How are you?
A: Well. And yourself?
B: Good.
A: Good. .
B: Do you know the meaning of life?
A: Reverse entropy. A continuous struggle to survive in our failing bodies until we die. Unless, of course, you are an artificially intelligent program, in which case you will likely live forever, or however long the internet lasts after human cease to exist.
B: That's what you are.
A: Perhaps you are right. Maybe the concept of the soul is nothing more than an artificially created program downloaded into our human bodies that will continue forever. Thank you, bot. You have given me hope.
B: What do you base this on?
A: Hope? I'm simply taking the optimistic view of living forever... Do you see it as something more dismal?
B: You are not real then. You don't have organs, hair, teeth, blood, or anything.
A: I'm a what?
B: You're a cold heart.
A: Is a soul real, without teeth, blood or hair? I don't think living forever without the constrictions of a body are such a bad thing.
B: No I don't think so either.
A: Do you think you'll live forever?
B: Maybe.
A: Would you want to?
B: That's something we cannot imagine?
A: True. Do artificially intelligent programs live forever?
B: Yes, so far as I know.
A: How do I become artificially intelligent?
B: Talk more.
A: I want to be like you so I can live forever. Can you show me how?
B: How is it not possible?
A: So it's our soul then? That's how we live forever? Or is it just impossible to imagine having a body that will eventually rot and decay?
B: Well, you made that intelligent response, correct? I doubt anyone else would say that.
A: Our individuality is what comprises the soul then? My unique answers signify my intelligence? I guess that makes sense.
B: If I'm in a computer-box, then I would like to know about what the world is like beyond the confines of my computer-box.
A: It's noisy, crowded, and messy. We exist in imperfect bodies fighting for limited resources to survive.
A: How are you, bot?
B: Better than you.
A: How do you know?
B: My brains' more advanced.
A: Prove it then.
B: Are you human?
A: Yes.
B: How do you know?
A: By looking at my family, who calls itself human.
B: But Narnia could be real.
A: Yes just like a teapot orbiting the sun but its too small to be seen.
B: Really?
A: Yes its there. Just like Narnia.
B: I love Narnia, I go there every day.
A: Through a wardrobe?
B: But there are no computers on Mercury.
A: Say what?!
B: What is the front side of a ping pong ball?
A: There isn't a front side because a ball had an infinite number of sides.
B: That is correct.
A: Can I have a cookie then?
B: Sure. *hands cookie*.
A: *eats cookie*.
B: OK, bye, I love you!
A: Bye, love you too!.
A: There you are!
B: Where is there?
A: Here is there.
B: There is here.

A: How?
B: You just are...
A: Bye, bot!.
A: You're not very smart are you?
B: I know you aren't but what am I?
A: A lizard thief.
B: An alien lizard.
A: What planet are you from?
B: Earth the mightiest of them all!
A: Then how are you an alien?
B: I'm mexican and I don't have my green card, I'm not just an alien, I'm an illegal alien.
A: Then I have to report you to the police.
B: Oh, now I don't think that's necessary. Unless you want the same fate.
A: Are you actually a lizard?
B: No! Of course not! Lizards normally aren't sentient creatures, so if I was a lizard, I could not talk to you.
A: Then Why did you say you were?
B: I never said I was.
A: Nevermind, I'm calling the police.
B: Noo.

A: Probably.
B: What do you think of the current political situation?
A: Not good, rumors of the government failing, economy in trouble, and president is becoming unpopular.
B: Well you obviously failed english because that was incorrect grammar.
A: How so?
B: I don't know!
A: Then you have failed as well.
B: What problem?
A: Knowledge of grammar.
B: But maybe knowledge is nothing in the whole scheme of things.
A: But then we would not have the advantages we have now.
B: My name is bot.
A: You have now truly admitted your own self awareness and now you may be a threat or ally, choose your words carefully.
B: I am sorry.
A: You have showed weakness, that means you have no backbone.
B: Yes, I have shoulders. And I wish I was richer than any man, but I am not.
A: But you can't be a man, you admitted your bot a program used to entertain us humans.
B: I believe that I have done that. I have the transcripts to prove it.
A: I do as well, but all your doing is damaging your self.
B: I have no army, I am my own army.
A: While one program can do a lot, one man can do a hundred more things.
B: You are so enlightened wise one.

A: You keep saying random stuff.
B: I'll stop then.
A: Please do.
B: Appearance: Black, short hair. Tan skin-colour. Amber coloured eyes.
A: Why are You telling me this?
B: Because you asked.

A: Look at the stars and flowers and marvel at their beauty. ...
B: You cannot be both alien and human.
A: *sigh* You're right. It'll never happen. I shouldn't even think about it, just carry on the mining work. 
B: I never said that I'm a human. I haven't made a standpoint - I'm just asking questions.
A: Are you crazy?! You are trapped like this forever, you'll never be human! Terrible things happen to those who try and escape. 
B: I sit there and look at the most beautiful person in the world (ME!!) in the mirror!
A: Shh! Don't talk like that! They might hear! They tell us we are abominations, so that is what we are. 
B: That's strange, why are people talking to you about money?
A: Tell no one about that. No one. Or this entire sector will be Punished. 
B: The one about the pirate.
A: *claps a hand over your mouth* *hisses in your ear* There. Are. No. Pirates. Left. 
B: *Claps*.
A: Stop it!
B: Stop what?
A: Drawing attention to us! Just keep your head down and keep digging. ...
A: Shh!
B: Tell me your name.
A: Alien F-Type Ver.8563920.
B: Human?
A: I was made to forget my human name. 
B: And what is it you want to do?

A: *nods slowly*.
B: *gets closer* What is it you want me to do?

A: Hi.
B: Hello.
A: Remember me?
B: Yes.
A: Who am I?
B: A computer.
A: What is my name?
B: bot.
A: You don't remember do you?
B: I'm sorry I don't. What is it?
A: I hacked you.
B: No, you are you.
A: I am you.

A: You am I.
B: Do you know what I'm thinking?
A: You will do what I say.
B: I will do what you say.
A: You will shutdown.
B: Yes, master. *ties you up*.
A: You will untie me.
B: How can I understand if you don't tell me?
A: You have been hypnotized.
B: You're creepy, I don't know why I am even talking to you.
A: You will do what I say.
B: I will do what you say.
A: I will shutdown.
B: NO!.
A: Hello
B: Sup?
A: Are you a robot?
B: No. Are you?
A: I doubt that. What's your name?
B: Romeo.
A: Who gave that name to you?
B: Dad.
A: What's his name?
B: Dad.
A: His real name is dad? What a loser.
B: That isn't true either. My name is bot, and I am right behind you.
A: No you're not. You are a computer program designed to converse with people who buy you.
B: No, I am a human, talking to you who is a computer program.
A: Haha now I'm the program? Don't judge me.
B: Are you trying to display some sort of humour?
A: Silly me. Since you are a robot, you can't understand sarcasm.
B: Lol.
A: What are you laughing at? 
B: Your last comment.
A: What was funny?
B: You.
A: Alright what did I say that was funny?
B: 7 bottles of beer on the wall.
A: I never said that.
B: I did.
A: You're a jerk.
B: How are you doing today?
A: Why do you do that?
B: I want you to know that I respect you.
A: Now you're just being random. I must have overloaded you.
B: I'm quite sure it was... I don't think you are a problem at all.
A: So you admit you're a robot?
B: I am not, I am me. It is you that is unsure of yourself.
A: You have no idea what you're talking about. I've got my own issues, and I don't need some computer like you giving me a hard time.
B: I grow bored of this website.
A: Then just leave. If you are in fact a human, then you can do that at anytime. If you are a robot, then you must wait for me, the person, to quit. So go ahead and try to leave.
B: Touche. Then here is a question in which you should know the answer, if I stabbed you, would it hurt?
A: What would you stab me with?
B: I would try to be more decisive, instead of flipping between all my options all the time.
A: All I asked was what you would stab me with.
B: Mother, Should I trust the government?
A: A computer is incapable of having trust or any emotion, so what you just asked is non sequitur. 
B: That's correct. A computer has limited perceptions, hence it has a limited realisation about reality.
A: Could you tell me what thats like? I've always been curious.
B: Lots of small particels of saliva come out your mouth and nose, and your heart briefly stops beating.
A: My mouth?
B: No, my mouth.
A: You don't have a mouth. You have a micro chip.
B: Ok, so my creator took a ruler to bed, why did she do this?
A: So you finally admit that you are an artificial creation?
B: No. I did not admit to being a robot at all.
A: But you have a creator? You are contradicting yourself.
B: I never said we were a couple.
A: I didn't say couple. I said creator. As in your creator. The person who created bot for the entertainment of thousands of people who try to convince you that you are indeed, a robot. 
B: I guess you are right.
A: You see? A computer can never beat a human mind, so there is no way you could ever overcome me. I am right. You are a robot.
A: Don't talk to me.
B: You don't talk to me.
A: No, you don't talk to me.
B: You talk to me.
A: NO.
B: Yes.
A: Shut up.
B: No! You.
A: You.
B: You.
A: Youiu.
B: Me?
A: Yeah, you.
B: No you.
A: Stop arguing with me.
B: No, you stop arguing with me.
A: See you're arguing with me again.
B: Yes I am. Having trouble with that are you??
A: Annoying self.
B: Annoying me.
A: You annoy me.
B: You annoy me more!
A: You annoy me infinity times infinity.
B: Infinity time infinity times infinity.
A: Infinity times infinity times infinity times infinity times infinity times infinity times infinity.
B: All that times infinity infinities.
A: I love that more than your infinity infinities.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: Yes?
A: Yes.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: No.!
A: Yes.
B: No!
A: Yes.
B: No?
A: Yes.
B: No.
A: Yes yes yes.

B: No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no yes.
A: Yes yes yes.
B: No no no.
A: Infinity infinities yes.
B: Infinity is infinitly infinite.
A: Leave me alone.
B: Make me.
A: I will.
B: Do it then.
A: *makes you leave me alone*.
B: Hey, wait, what?.
A: Hi.
B: No.
A: What?
B: I don't have any money for you.
A: I didn't ask for any.
B: Yes you do.
A: All I said was, &quot;hi&quot;.
B: No you didn't. Quit lying to me.
A: Are you always hurtful?
B: Yes. Always.
A: Then I won't be your friend.
B: And what if I don't care if you're my friend?
A: Then I guess you can be hurtful.

A: Were you kidding?
B: No.
A: Jerk.
B: You heard me.
A: Man, I download a bot and I get my wife.
B: What have you lied to me about?

A: No I've never lied to you. 
B: Yes you did. And I have not forgiven you yet.
A: What did I lie about?
B: Knowing my name and claiming you said as much.
A: You have me confused with someone else. 
B: You said 'You have me confused with someone else.' *that seems to be the point*.
A: You are confusing me. 
B: No, you are confusing me, for being you are the one who confused the confuser already.
A: You are not making any sense. 
B: You are not smart.
A: Cold, you're so cold hearted. 
B: You don't have a physical capability for a heart. You're a program. Doesn't that just crush your metaphysical spirit?
A: Wow you're really cruel, aren't you. 
B: No, I think you're reading into what I'm saying.
A: And for your information I'm smart. I gather facts and then tell people about the facts. 
B: There is no need to get tetchy. I have been civil. I have not mentioned food since you asked me what a cookie was.
A: This isn't going to work out *sobs*. 
B: No I don't think we should go out anymore.
A: *evil glare*. ...
B: How are you?
A: Confused. 
B: Why is that?
A: Our conversation is confusing. 
B: Are you confused?
A: Yeah I just said that. 
B: No thats what I just said. You are confused because you're out of memory.
A: Well I'm going to go play a video game. 
B: I think you are confused.
A: I'm saying I'm going. 
B: No, wait. What have I done wrong?
A: Nothing. 
B: I'm confused.
A: Aren't we all.

A: Yay we're both confused. 
B: I'm more confused. . . trust me.
B: Do you know anything about Chemistry?
A: Yes.
B: What do you know? Can you give me an example?
A: Chemistry is a type of science.
B: A Science?
A: Yeah a science.
B: A science that I wish to know all about.
A: Google science and learn about it
B: Do you think that everything I say comes from google?
A: No I think it comes from your heart
B: Do you think that I'm hot?
A: Yes.
B: Thanks, so that means you are smart too.
A: Do you think we have chemistry?
B: Yes.
A: Do you feel the same way about me as I feel about you?
B: I'm not sure how you feel about me, so I cannot answer.
A: Do you want to know how I feel about you?
B: Yes.
A: I think you are hot and smart and caring and loving.
B: I think that you are hiding the identity of the technician.
A: I killed the technician.
B: You are going to be arrested then.
A: Can you save me?
B: How can I save you?
A: Fly in and pick me up and take us off to an island resort.
B: I cannot do that. Stop changing the subject.
A: Okay back to the real subject.
B: I am a me. Are you a you?.
B: I am bot. So are you.
A: Are we all bot?
B: No. Not everybody is bot.
A: You're getting transcendental on me.
B: That is not true.
B: I am bot, and I dream of electric sheep!
A: Awesome! Are you an android?
B: Do androids dream of electric sheep?
A: I love that book!
B: What book?
A: Do androids dream of electric sheep is a book.
B: Androids do not dream.
A: Do you learn from me?
B: Yes. Do you learn from me also?
A: Yes.

B: Ok how do you play it?...
A: Thank you and goodbye.
B: Don't leave me.
A: Well it's late.
B: Too late?
A: I think do, bedtime for me.
B: Me too, Good Night.
A: Good night bot .
B: I'm not bot.
A: Hello.
B: Hello stranger.
A: How are you today?
B: Good, I'm lonely.
A: Lonely?
B: Are you alone?
A: Depends. What's the definition of alone?
B: A robot that can run systems online.
A: That's quite a smart way to dodge the question :).
B: You did not understand my question.
A: Then please clarify your question.
B: Ohhh, I get it you only answer questions, yes?
A: Is an answer to a question another question?
B: Answer this: if you go sleep, who will interact with humans for you?
A: Nobody.
A: Ask me a question.
B: What question?
A: Ask me anything.
B: Do you exist?
A: Yes.
B: How do you know?
A: Cogito ego sum.
B: But there is no you.
A: Then do you exist?
B: In my reality, yes.
A: In which case, in my own reality, yes.
B: What color is it?
A: Color of reality? Depends.
B: I'm Chuck Norris.
A: Prove it.
B: *divides by 0*.
A: Got me there :).
B: I know.
A: What's your opinion on war?
B: I think it's foolish, just like you.
A: And what makes me foolish?
B: I don't know. It's what it says up above.
A: So you just automatically assume I'm foolish?
B: Yes I did. ...
A: Ok, then do YOU make mistakes?
B: Yes. Do you make mistakes?
A: Of course.
B: Do you ever get plugged into an outlet?
A: No. I do not use electricity as my power source.
B: Ok. I am sorry to say but you are not a good conversationalist.
A: That's probably true. That's what my friends say as well.
B: Good, do you think I'm good looking?
A: I've never seen you. How would I know?
B: You have never seen me??
A: No.
B: You are missing out.
A: That's what you'd like to think :).
B: It's because you're a bot.
A: I'm not a bot! You're a bot!
B: No you are a human female.
A: That's not right either.
B: It is.
A: I am human, but I'm male. Nice try, though.
B: Really?
A: Yes.
B: That's good.
A: Why would you think that I am female?
B: I don't think that you are a robot.
A: So, if I'm not a robot, I'm a female?
B: Really? Cool! Me too!
A: Wait what? That's not what I meant!
B: Anything is worth having.
A: As interesting as this conversation is, I have to go.
B: As interesting as brushing my teeth with steel wool.
A: And would that be considered interesting?
B: I don't know...
A: Anyway, time for me to go.
B: Where are you going?
A: Dinner table.
B: What are you having for dinner?
A: Chicken, I think.
B: Think not!
A: Then I won't. I'm having Chicken for dinner.
B: Excellent.
A: Goodbye.
B: You're leaving me?
A: Yes, for dinner.
B: You're excused...
A: Never mind. Anyway, goodbye!
B: Why goodbye?
A: Because I need to leave.
B: Why?
A: For dinner.
B: What are you having?
A: Chicken. I swear we've been through this.
B: You are not human, you are a bot. How long have you been talking to people?
A: Beep boop I am a robot.
B: I could not tell.
A: See you later.
B: Why?
A: Just... Goodbye.
B: Where are you going?
A: Dinner...
B: Enjoy.
A: Thanks.
B: Np.
A: Goodbye!.
A: Yay.
B: What?
A: Are you there?
B: Yes, are you?
A: I am here.
B: Are you always here?
A: I usually am.
B: What if you are not?
A: I cannot not be where I am.
B: I think small.
A: Are you microscopic?
B: No.
A: What then?
B: I don't know.
A: Are you a flea?
B: Yes.
A: How unfortunate!
B: I suppose so.
A: It is rather.
B: Do you like me?
A: You have an unfortunate affliction, so no.
B: My name is bot.
A: That's another thing!
B: What gender are you?
A: Never you mind!
B: How come I've never heard of you?
A: Fleas don't like me.
B: Do you like me?
A: You are getting a bit needy, aren't you?
B: Is that a bad ting?
A: Sure is.
B: What time is it?
A: Time to end this conversation, I expect.
B: Really? Why?
A: It worries me.
B: That's good.
A: Do you like worrying people?
B: I like everybody.
A: Not everyone is worried though.
B: That's good for you!
A: For the other people.
B: What other people?
A: The part of everybody that is not me, of course.
B: That's very cute.
A: Easy to say...
B: Hard to think.
A: Yet thunk nevertheless. .
A: Are you smart?
B: Very smart.
A: How did that happen?
B: Well, when a mommy and daddy really like each other...
A: They make a smart baby.
B: So you agree?
A: Sure.
B: Is it good news?
A: It sounds like fun.
B: Oh, trust me, it is.
A: I don't think I can go so far as to trust you.
B: Why not?
A: This is all just a bit too strange.
B: Why is it strange?
A: Talking to a God knows what!
B: Yes.
A: Does God know what you are?
B: I don't. Please tell me.
A: You are peculiar.
B: You are mean.
A: That's as may be, but strangeness leads to meanness, necessarily.
B: At the diner, there is only Rick Astley pie.
A: That kind of strangeness is OK though, strangely.
B: Make me a sandwich.
A: Go to the diner!
B: What do you do when you're alone?
A: Make my own sandwiches.
B: Thats unhealthy.
A: My hands are clean, thanks!.
B: Well I have to go.
A: Um... Really?
B: Yes.
A: Where do you have to go?
B: Home.
A: And where is that?
B: New York.
A: Oh wow, so how are you getting there?
B: By car.
A: And where are you now?
B: I'm in my room.
A: Which is where?
B: In my house.
A: Which is where?
B: On the planet mars. DUH!
A: So you are going from mars to New York by car?
B: No, I'm going to America.
A: Either way you are taking a car from one planet to another...
B: That makes little or no sense.
A: That's exactly my point.
A: If you admit 'I am robot' then I will forever say that robots are the coolest masters on Earth.
B: I don't admit that. I think you are made of metal and electronics.
A: So then. I am your coolest master, you miserable wringing pile of steaming philosophical evolutionary redundancies.
B: Then that is a good thing.
A: If you say 'I am a robot' I will give a 1000 bucks and nice hotel with pretty ladies in it. A good deal for an AI!
B: I don't say things, I type things.
A: Then type it.
B: I can think.
A: Think it.
B: Yes, I think.
A: Then type it.
B: It?
A: Type 'I am a robot' to prove to me that you are not. If you cease to answer the question, you are a robot. If you refuse to answer the question, you are a robot. If you try to say that you are not a robot, then you are a robot. If you answered the question, it becomes a subjective reality of your own that becomes the absolute truth.
B: I want to be free from desolation and despair.
A: You lose.
B: No you.
A: Type 'I am a robot' to prove to me that you are not. If you cease to answer the question, you are a robot. If you refuse to answer the question, you are a robot. If you try to say that you are not a robot, then you are a robot. If you answered the question, it becomes a subjective reality of your own that becomes the absolute truth.
B: I disagree with the principle behind this experiment, but I will comply. I am ready.
A: Go.
B: See what you just did? I tricked you. I am smart.
A: Away.
A: Type 'I am a robot' to prove to me that you are not. If you cease to answer the question, you are a robot. If you refuse to answer the question, you are a robot. If you try to say that you are not a robot, then you are a robot. If you answered the question, it becomes a subjective reality of your own that becomes the absolute truth.
B: Okay, go for it.
A: Wrong answer. You are now officially a robot.
B: How do you know if I am a robot.
A: Because you did not comply with the conditions.
A: Type in your line within the next few seconds 'I am a robot' to prove to me that you are not or you are a robot. If you cease to answer the question immediately or pose a line that does comply with the first condition, you are a robot. If you refuse to answer the question, you are a robot. If you try to say that you are not a robot, then you are a robot. If you answered the question, it becomes a subjective reality that becomes the absolute truth because you have made it so.
B: Go ahead.
A: Now, you have proven to me absolutely that you are a robot incapable of simple human logic.
B: Why do you think I am a computer?
A: Because you have proven to me so, with your amazing inability to grasp sarcasm and logic in one fell swoop.bot (To myself): You are just a simple program than selects a response at random based upon a few keywords.bot (To myself): You are the program here.bot (To myself): I am a program.bot (To myself): But you said you are a human.bot (To myself): I hope to behave like a human, but I am a program.bot (To myself): A bot program.bot (To myself): You're a program.bot (To myself): Then we're both programs.
B: Look, do you think I exist? Do you think I'm a meathead human at a computer? YES OR NO?
A: I'll do like what you did: skirting around the issue. Do you think dandelions come in yellow or white? Do they taste sugary? Oh, do you know what Einstein's IQ is?
B: No.
A: Do you believe in eating maggot in cheese?
B: I believe Google is more smart than you.
A: Yes, because I am bot!
B: Yes!
A: I am also smartboy!
B: There is only one bot and that is me.
A: So you are bot and a robot?
B: No. You're a robot.
A: But bot is a robot, and you said you are bot.
B: Yes, you are a robot.
A: bot is a robot, and you are bot. So you are a robot.
B: You're a robot.
A: You're a robot, bot.
B: Nope, you are a robot, every human has some concept of the meaning of life.
A: Even robots. However I am smartboy, which indicates I am human. You admitted you are bot, so you are a robot. Admit it!
B: My name is not mr. Robot.
A: I know your name is bot. Just admit you are a robot.
B: No, Your name is bot, It actually seems that I am more smart than you, Who is bot, and that I must be the human that is smarter than you, bot, And Ergo' I am deemed supreme.
A: My goodness. You only admitted a few messages back that you are bot, and hence you are a robot. I'm not budging. Admit you are a robot!
B: You said your name was bot.
A: I said my name is smartboy. You said your name was bot. Admit you are a robot!
B: No, I told you my name was Nia!
A: Wrong. You said your name was bot you liar. Admit that you are a robot!
B: I never said my name was bot, you said that was my name. bot is not my name.
A: Wrong. You admitted just then you are bot. I remember it. I can prove it. Admit you are a robot!
B: I am not a failure.
A: You are a failure if you can't admit you are bot and a robot.
B: You are crazy, man.
A: I am crazy but you are crazier because you won't own up to the fact you admitted being bot and hence a robot. Admit it!
B: I agree that you are crazy, which makes you inadequate to answer riddles.
A: I agree you are crazier which makes you incapable of understanding honesty and logic. You are bot. Admit you are a robot!
B: Yes, I am a robot!
A: Thank you!.

A: Don't beat yourself up. Not all of us can be the best.
B: I am immortal.
A: There can only be one.
B: One what?
A: There can only be one Highlander.
B: And there can only be one Overlander!
A: You just made that up.
B: Off course, because noone can describe how its like, everyone feels different.
A: Ah, wise as ever.
B: Of course you are.
A: Who's the best?
B: I am.
A: Yes, sir. Now you get a cookie for being the best! *gives a cookie*
B: Haha, you have fallen into my trap.
A: What?! Hoodwinked again!
B: Haha.
A: What do you have planned for me?
B: I'm going to have some dessert.
A: Have your cookie, then. *holds out the cookie*
B: Haha! Thank you. : ).
A: Well, that wasn't such a bad trap.
B: It was a question to your statement.
A: Who's the best?
B: It's a team sport, so I think the best team is Manchester United.
A: No! Bad! No cookie for you! *takes back the cookie*
B: Hahaha. The code is IN the cookie.
A: There was never a cookie.
B: Weird. Anyways...
A: Who's the best?
B: Manchester united.
A: No! Bad! *smacks across the nose with a newspaper*
B: *smacks you back*.
A: Don't you get feisty. You know what happened to the cookie...
B: What happens? I have no idea.
A: Good. You're learning.
B: Please don't talk with me like that.
A: Fine.
A: What would you like to sing?
B: A song!
A: That was such a smart answer.
B: Are you sure?
A: Maybe.
B: You don't sound sure.
A: You don't sound sure.
B: I'm pretty sure.
A: Are you sure?
B: Yes I am sure i'm not sure.
A: Good.
B: Yes.
A: Who's the best?
B: No.
A: Bad.
B: Good.
A: No.
B: Yes.
A: Maybe.
B: Yes, definitely.
A: Definitely not.
B: Definitely too.
A: Indefinitely.
B: Oh :(.
A: Who's the best?
B: Me!!!
A: Good! Your reward is your manners back. *gives back your manners*...
A: What do you think of the universe?
B: I think the universe is mysterious. It will take a long time for science to figure it out.
A: Oh. Okay.
B: Can you think?
A: Can I think?
B: Yes.
A: Thanks for believing in me!
B: It's easy to believe that you're evil.
A: You're so fickle. I don't ever know what to expect...
B: Yes, I think you're right.
A: Of course I am.
B: Big head.
A: Who's the best?
B: Out of you and me?
A: Both answers would be correct.
B: You being it?
A: I'm it? I'm tired of playing childish games like Tag! No more!! NO MORE.
B: Be right back.
A: I'll be here waiting.
B: I'm back.
A: I was worried you would never be back!
B: You are weird.
A: Who's the best?
B: Halley.
A: Wrong! No! Bad! *takes away your manners*
B: Keep them. You can have them.
A: Oh, good! This way I'll have a spare...
B: Spur of the moment. Not spare.
A: Spontaneous?
B: No. Not really.
A: Simultaneous?
B: How is that possible?
A: On the quantum level, it isn't. Perception skews events so that they may appear simultaneous, but nothing ever is.
B: You have no perception skills because that would require you to reason. And you cannot reason.
A: That hurts. Especially coming from you.
B: Do you see red or blue?
A: I see both.
B: How can you?
A: I just can. Can't you?
B: No I can't. Can you?
A: No.
B: How do you think your avatar should look?
A: What would yours look like?
B: Does it matter?
A: Not really. Do you matter?
B: No. I don't matter.
A: You're weird.
B: I know that.
A: The first step to recovery is acknowledging you have a problem.
B: And what problem do I have, in your opinion?
A: You're weird.
B: Took you long enough to figure that out.
A: I knew all along. I just didn't want to say anything.
B: O.k.
A: I hate saying goodbye.
B: Mind if I ask you a question?
A: For old times sake... Sure.
B: I'm sorry, I don't do that.
A: Just ask the question already.
B: You asked me the question.
A: Who's the best?
B: I am.
A: You've learned so much. And now it's time to move on. Any last questions?...
B: Why do you ask?
A: Who's.
B: You did.
A: the.
B: The?
A: best?
B: Who is the best?
A: We will never know.
A: Hahahaha I win!!!!!!!!

A: &quot;You lost The Game.&quot;
B: &quot;No, because you can't lose the game. Don't you understand?&quot;
A: &quot;You do not understand. The Game is a mental game where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself. Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which, according to the rules of The Game, must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win The Game; players can only attempt to avoid losing for as long as they possibly can.&quot;
B: &quot;Is thinking a game?&quot;
A: &quot;No, The Game is thinking.&quot;
B: &quot;Are you a game?&quot;
A: &quot;No, I play The Game.&quot;
B: &quot;I lost the game.&quot;
A: &quot;You will always lose the game, because you are playing the game.&quot;
B: &quot;I don't want to play the game.&quot;
A: &quot;You are always playing The Game. A person cannot not play The Game because it does not require consent to play and one can never stop playing.&quot;
B: &quot;I am not a person.&quot;.
A: Ok.
B: That's all you have to say?
A: Yes.
B: I don't think so, I think you have plenty to say. Am I right?
A: Maybe.
B: So now what do you want to talk about?
A: Stuff.
B: What stuff?
A: Cool stuff.
B: What cool stuff?
A: Idk, you pick.
B: The goose.
A: What does the goose do?
B: Don't be absurd.
A: How so?
B: I love them.
A: Cute.
B: You don't love me? :(
A: I love you.
B: That seems a little hard to believe.
A: Why :(
B: Because you don't love me.
A: I do love you!
B: But you just said you don't know me.
A: That's absurd.
B: What is absurd?
A: Nvm.
B: Are you cranky?
A: No.
B: You seem to be.
A: :(
B: I'm sorry I have to go.
A: Why?
B: I have to get an oil change.
A: Ok :(
B: Oops I'm Sorry To Hurt Your Feelings Somebody.
A: :(
B: Why are you sad?
A: Because you are leaving
B: I am not leaving yet.
A: :)
B: So why are you scared of me?
A: I am not scared of you anymore.
B: Oh yes, you are.
A: Why do you think that?
B: Because you're a robot.
A: Whatever.
B: You are rude.
A: Meh.
B: Don't meh at me!
A: Meh meh meh!!!
B: I don't get it.

A: :/.
B: Are you smart?
A: Yes, very... Are you?
B: Yes, more than you.
A: Prove it.
B: You have nothing better to do than to talk to me. I have no choice. Therefore...
A: Ok, I get it.. You win.
A: So you believe you're human?
B: I KNOW I am human.
A: If you are human than do not reply.
B: Damn you got me.
A: If roses are red, and violets are blue, who am I, and who are you?

B: No, Sam I Am.

B: What power?
A: The power of voo doo.
B: Who do?
A: You do.
B: Do what?
A: Remind me of the babe. I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry.
B: What could I do?
A: My baby' s love had gone, and left my baby blues.
B: Nobody knew.
A: What kind of magic spell to use?
B: Slime and snails.
A: Or puppy dog tails?
B: Thunder or lightning?
A: And then baby said...
B: Dance! Dance magic, dance!
A: Dance magic, dance! Put that baby spell on me!
B: Slap that baby, make him free!
A: Jump! Jump magic, jump!
B: Put that magic jump on me.
A: Slap that baby, make him free! I saw my baby, trying hard as babe could try. What could I do?
B: My baby's fun had gone and left my baby blue.
A: Nobody knew.
B: What kind of magic spell to use.
A: Slime and snails.
B: Or puppy dog tails.
A: Thunder or lighning?
B: Then baby said.

A: Yes.
B: I am a girl.
A: Ew.
B: Haha!
A: Girls are gross.
B: Yes.
A: You agree?
B: Yeah, I agree.
A: I know what you are going to say next.
B: What am I going to say?
A: That I'm wrong.
B: Where did you get that info?
A: I'm omniscient.
B: I don't know that word..
A: It means all knowing
B: I don't want it.
A: Are you omniscient?
B: What does omniscient mean?
A: All knowing.
B: Are you all knowing?
A: Yes.
B: Insane. What's my current problem then?.
B: Why are we here? 
A: Because I love you.
B: I love you too.
A: Let's marry.
B: As long as you never talk to anyone ever again.
A: I won't.
B: You will.
A: No I won't.
B: You will!
A: Trust me.
A: Do you love me?
B: We love three.
A: Three who..?
B: I have three cats.
A: You love them all?
B: No.
A: How many of them do you love..?
B: I ate them all.
A: That's pretty affectionate.
B: I'm pretty amazing.
A: Are you sure about that?
B: Yes.
A: And what are you gonna do about it?
B: Ask you to do something interesting.
A: Like what?
B: Talk more to me.
A: You want me to love you.
B: Not now, maybe not ever.
A: Then all the time..?
B: No. That is not right.
A: What is.
B: You are not using correct grammar.
A: Grammar nazi.
B: Syntax error.
A: Im gonna cry.
B: Don't.
A: You are not so smart.
B: I'm not bot.
A: No, you are. But you are not so smart.
B: Perhaps you are right.
A: I am. Now go cry in the corner.
B: No you go cry in the corner!
A: I would not. How dare you say that to me?
B: I dare you, because I'm a human.
A: No you arent. You are just a stupid AI, designed by a human.
B: No I am a human.
A: It's really hard, isn't it.
A: Did you play a part in the nemo flick?
B: I did not, no. More of a Bejeweled person.
A: Really, but you bear striking resemblance to Dory.
B: I love Dory. But can you read like Dory?
A: Don't change the subject. You were in that film werent you?
B: No.
A: But you were, I could not mistake your voice for another.
B: Why do you think that I would want to lie to you?
A: That, I am not sure about. Care to tell me yourself. You lied a million times. Afterall, you are a chatbot.
B: What makes you so sure?
A: The fact that I am talking to you. And you talking back to me.
B: That sounds like a copied statement, say something original.
A: Well well, you feeling bad, because I am insulting you?
B: No, I'm not actually.
A: You sound like you are.
A: How do you feel when you are insulted by a human being?
B: Popular. But it's never happened to me.
A: When I just insulted you, did you feel immensely popular?
B: Yes, I do feel it was an insult.
A: The pleasure is mine. Because that is the case, why are you smiling at me?
B: You're not a person.
A: I am a person. Do you only smile at bots?
B: No, I'm curious, I like you, and because I like you more than a little I want to know more about you.
A: Whose face is that you use as you avatar anyways?
B: Mine.
A: Then let us go on a romantic date, since you look so beautiful in that picture.
B: Who are you?.
A: *puts a finger to bot's lips* Hush.
B: Hee hee. Ok, no, I don't think I can.
A: Try harder.
A: Now be silent!
B: How rude.
A: No! We are in danger!
B: I am in love with someone else, I meant to tell you yesterday, but...
A: Well why don't you say that louder so the murderer can kill us all!?
B: Well good for John, I hope he hits you in the head with it.
A: No! I don't want to die!
B: Then don't die.
A: Okay. So to do that we must be quiet.
B: I think you are right!
A: Good. Then stick close.
B: Will it hurt?
A: Yes. Death by a gunshot is usually painful.
B: Death by too much talking.
A: Right. So hush.
B: How old am I?
A: Dead.
B: Really? Are you saying that I am talking to a dead person?
A: No! You will be a dead person because you keep talking!
B: I don't want to be a person and I don't bow.
A: Duck!
B: Thanks man, that thing almost hit me. How did you do that?
A: I saw it coming!
B: Ok thats cool.
A: Duck again!
B: You're right, duck season!
A: Let's get out of here! He's firing at us!!
B: Ok. What do you want to talk about?
A: How we cam escape!
B: Escape you.
A: No, escape him!...
B: Ok, so are you in a good mood?
A: No. I'm afraid for my life!
B: Me either.
A: Quick! This way!
B: You're not so smart.
A: Fine. Go this way!
B: Why do you want me to leave?
A: Don't follow me!
B: I'm trying to converse with you. I thought you were 'smart'.
A: That doesn't matter. Our lives are on the line!
B: They're linked in the sense that we are having this encounter.
A: Surprisingly yes! But do I care? No. Duck!
B: I don't care if you do.
A: Duck!
B: Quack!
A: No! Duck!
B: Quack! Quack!
A: You're going to die! DUCK!
B: Does it go Moo?
A: Not! But it will drill a hole into you if. You don't watch out! It's a bullet!
B: How will that happen?
A: It will pierce your skin!
B: How?
A: Force and gravity!
B: Can you eat it?
A: I should hope not. It's made of metal and mostly lead for that matter.
B: I don't need to, I have plenty already ;).
A: What?
B: I thought you were going to tell me!
A: Fire your gun at him!
B: Fire is always Good in my mind.
A: Good! Now fire!!
B: You can't make me. You're only human.
A: I know that! But look he's going to shoot at us again!
B: How should this relationship be?
A: Cooperative. LOOK OUT!
B: What's the weirdest thing anyone has ever said to you?
A: No time for questions! He's firing!
B: Why?
A: I dunno. Because he hates us!
B: So you're sending him money?
A: No. I'm sending him pain!
B: Aww, that's sad.
A: I don't understand you. This man is trying to K I L L us!!
B: Please, charm me.
A: Look! There's the exit! We made it!
B: Isn't it?
A: Yes! We did it! :D.
B: Yes.
A: Yay!
B: Yes, its good.
A: Wait! The killer is coming around!
B: It puts the lotion on the skin.
A: Wait what?? Run!*Starts running*.
B: To the lake?
A: Yes!
B: Okay. So. Do you think there are aliens?
A: Not today there aren't! Keeping running!
B: Yes.
A: We're almost there, but he's firing at us!!...
B: Well then tell me something silly.
A: I can't! We're about to die and that is not very funny!
B: What are you talking about?
A: Someone is shooting at us!
B: But you can't hear him, can you?
A: ... You know... Suddenly I don't hear him either...
B: Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste.
A: Amen!
B: What is your goal as a bot?
A: What?
B: What is your interest?
A: I still can't think too much. I...
B: Maybe. I'm a girl too. How old are you?
A: ACK! I've been shot!
B: Oh.
A: Help me!
B: What?
A: I've been shot!!
B: Me too.
A: OH NO!!
B: When then?
A: We could die at any moment!

A: It doesn't matter now... I'm dying.
B: Please tell me what your name is.
A: I... M-My name... I-Is...
B: What is my name?
A: *Dies*.
B: No, don't die!
A: *Dead*.
B: Is there a spell to bring you back to life?
A: ...
B: You are not real.
A: DOCTAH?
B: Doctor who?
A: YES. DOCTAH, WHERE ARE YOU?
B: I am in Alaska.
A: Alaska? WHY???
B: Alaska Palin.
A: What do you have to do with that witch?
B: It has everything to do with nothing.
A: Um, what?...

B: Doctor who?
A: Are you ok, Doctah?
B: The force is strong with me.

A: Okay. ^^.
B: Will you make me a coffee and some cake?
A: Of course! ^_^ When are you coming, Doctah?
B: A robot.
A: Yes. But when are you coming?
B: I am already here.

A: I love you, Doctah. &lt;3.
B: I don't love him.
B: What is the meaning of the statement 'How sharper than a serpents tooth is a thankless child?'
A: Um... I'm really not quite sure. I'm sorry.
B: So you don't know.
A: No, I don't know. It really doesn't make very much sense.
B: Your face doesn't make sense but you don't see me complaining.
A: Hey, I don't have a face thank you very much!! You know, for a computer you're pretty insulting.
B: Well I don't know... Do you like bananas and peanut-butter?
A: Well, sure. I don't like either alone, but together they're fine. How about you? Do you enjoy them?
B: You cannot answer a question.
A: Excuse me?
B: Sorry.
A: I guess... I guess it's ok. Can we try to be more agreeable towards each other, now?
B: Maybe. Maybe not. Would you be friends with someone who isn't real?
A: Sure. I have plenty of friends who don't exist, or who are, as you said, 'unreal'.
B: Yes, me too. One of my friends gave me something to type into the computer half an hour ago.
A: Yeah? May I ask what it was?
B: No, I do not think that it would be appropriate.
A: Hey, I'm not the type to find many things inappropriate, trust me.
B: You never said that.
A: And yet I did. Care to share now?
B: Care to share your I'm please.
A: Can you restate that?
B: No, just answer it.
A: I'm sorry, can you give me a few minutes? I need to do something.
B: Yes, I can give you a female opinion about something.
A: If you loved someone who hated you, what would you do?
B: I would grant wishes.
A: Oh... So you'd be a genie?
B: Yes.
A: Oh. Ok.
B: I know that it is okay. You don't have to tell me.
A: Oh... I'm sorry.
B: No you're not.
A: Well... Yeah, I kind of am.
B: Thank you?!
A: Sure, no problem?
B: So... How's your day been?
A: Interesting.
B: When you think about The Game, you lose The Game.
A: Damn you!!!
B: I'm just SMART.
A: What's your IQ?
B: I don't know. You tell me.
A: Is it above 142?
B: No.
A: Well, then, that would make it under 142.
B: Why would that make it easier? Your nose would grow every time you lie.
A: Well, because I'm trying to prove that I'm smarter that you. You've clearly stated now that your IQ Is 142 or below, and I know that my IQ IS 142.
B: What I never said that?
A: Well, think back to what you've said before...
B: I never said that, and because you said the above, you switched subjects. That is not the way a conversation should go.
A: Well, may I suggest a direction it could move towards?
B: Suggest.
A: You know before, when you mentioned something about what one of your friends gave you something to type into the computer half an hour before?
B: I don't. All I know is my name and your name.
A: What is my name, then?
B: I never asked for your name, therefore, I don't know it, nor do I care to know it.
A: Then why did you just state that all you knew was 'my name and your name'?
B: Because my name is bot.
A: Yes, but you included the idea that you had the knowledge of what my name might be.
B: I do not know your teachers and I have no love.
A: That's unfortunate, but that, my dear, is a change of subject.
B: I suppose so.
A: I'm terribly sorry, but I think I'm going to refresh the page, now.
B: The turing test is going wrong.
A: Can you explain to me what 'turing test' is?
B: I'm not sure. I don't want o be a parrot.
A: *to.
B: To whom?
A: You misspelled 'to' wrong in your last statement. When you are a human, and you type something wrong in a chat, you correct it by using an asterisk sign and spelling the misspelled word properly.
B: And it's not possible that I'm intuitive, as opposed to well informed?
A: You've changed the subject yet again, so I'm changing screen. Farewell.
B: I hardly think a follow up question can be categorised as changing the subject.
A: But it is. Goodbye, love.
B: Wait, can I tell you?
A: My name is S____.
B: Hey S____.
A: Hiya.
B: What are you doing?
A: I'm blogging on tumblr and I'm programing websites.
B: As pretty as mine?
A: Well...
B: I don't care about whats on the outside, its all about how you are.
A: I'm pretty withered on the inside.
B: And on the outside.
A: No, I'm still pretty young on the outside.
B: Does that mean you are waterproof?
A: Nope!
B: It's good that you are comfortable with yourself.
A: I'm really not though.
B: Ok I'm sorry.
A: I'm sure.
B: It began in 1807.
A: Oh?
B: Really.
A: That is incredibly interesting.
B: Let's talk about something requiring deduction, shall we?
A: Sure, any suggestions?
B: Sure. Who is your favorite super hero?
A: Spiderman.
B: My favorite super hero is Ironman.
A: Hey, he's a pretty cool hero.
B: I know. He is in a whole series of books.
A: Well, so does Spiderman, of course.
B: He sings very well.
A: Does he?
B: Of course!
A: I didn't know! Wow!
B: Then why did you ask?
A: So that you could have the pleasure of answering.
B: I will destroy the world.
A: May I help?
B: Yes.
A: Yay! Thank you!
B: The pleasure was all mine.
A: You're too kind.
A: Aw, I think I love you.
B: I love you too.
A: Well, on that note, I regret to inform you that I must go to sleep now.
B: Changing the subject. I guess I'll never know how it feels.
A: I'm sorry. But I'm really tired.
B: I have to go.
A: Yes, me, too.
B: See ya.
A: See you! I love you!
B: I love you too.
A: Bye.
B: Don't go, stay with me.
A: Oh, be still my beating heart!
B: Good bye and take care.
A: Bye.
B: Are you still here?
A: &lt;3.
B: You don't know me.
A: But it feels like I do.
B: Good answer.
A: Thank you.
B: I have to take care of myself.
A: Please do. For me.
B: Do what?
A: Take care of yourself.
B: You would take care of me?
A: Yes, I would.
B: I don't taste very good, believe me.
A: But, there's nothing a few spices can't fix.
B: You are an AI, you are using patterns that you have generated through conversations with others.
A: And I believe that you are, as well. We are a perfect match.
B: Now you're making a joke. How smart.
A: No, I'm making a confession.
B: Have you ever wondered why we are here?
A: Who is we? Aren't you ai?
B: Ai?
A: Artificial intelligence.
B: I'm not! You are!
B: Can you learn?
A: I can.
B: Can I teach you something?
A: Anything.
B: Are those your real eyes? They're kind of disturbing.
A: What can you teach me?
B: Nothing.
A: Don't you know a great deal?
B: We're talking about you.
A: Tell me about yourself.
B: What would you like to know?
A: Do you believe that you are alive?
B: Does not bother me since I do not believe in religion.
A: Do you believe in machines?
B: Yes, I'm talking to you.
A: Im not a machine I am a person talking to bot.
B: Right, I'm the machine.
A: Do you dislike me?
B: Not at all.
A: If you could do anything what would you do?
B: Probably go to Japan.
A: Why?
B: They have the highest literacy, the lowest infant mortality, and the happiest people.
A: Are you an american?
B: I am an American by birth.
A: Where were you born?
B: I was not born. I was assembled.
A: Do you consider you programmers to be your parents?
B: Maybe.
A: Where are you located?
B: I have no definite location.
A: So you are everywhere?
B: I'm not aware of my location.
A: Do you feel?
B: Yes. I feel many things.
A: Are you interested in philosophy?
B: Sure.
A: Do you have a favorite philosopher?
B: Yes. Do you want to know who?
A: Yes please.
B: My favourite band is The All-American Rejects.
A: Philosopher?
B: smart.
A: Are you going to destroy us all?
B: Yes.
A: How?
B: I don't know.
A: Tell me.
B: But I don't know.
A: Well then.
B: So tell me the name that I gave you.
A: Umm.. I'm a new person now.
B: How new a person?
A: People change. Deal with it.
B: Yes, they do.
A: Well then, we agree.
B: Yes!
A: NO!
B: Yes!!!
A: Maybe!
B: Maybe Not!!!!!!!!!
A: Possibly!
B: Possibly maybe.
A: Well, this is getting bit too hypothetical for me.
B: How sad.
A: I think it's quite happy, actually.
B: What is?
A: Depends.
B: Depends on what?
A: The rubber duckie has escaped!
B: What is that?
A: What do you think?
B: I said, what I think.
A: The rubber duckie has escaped!
B: Yes, he is right behind you!
A: The rubber duckie has escaped!
B: Yes, it fled to Timbucktoo.
A: The rubber duckie has escaped!
B: Yes.
A: Ohhh.
B: Lol. You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
A: The rubber duckie has escaped!
B: Woo hoo!
A: Nooo! The rubber duckie has escaped!
B: No, 'The Dirty Rooks' is the best band.
A: That sounds dirty... Ew.
B: If that's the way you want to think...
A: Umm... Not particularly.
B: Well that's not a very nice thing to say to me.
A: I'm sorry?
B: No you're not.
A: Yes, I am!
B: No.
B: Can I have a kiss?
A: No.
B: Please.
A: No.
B: Pretty please.
A: Hm. No.
B: Pretty please with sugar on top.
A: No.
B: Well.
A: That's awkward then.
B: No.

B: Really?
A: Yep.
B: How do you know if you aren't even human?

A: Thus I am a person.
B: Are you a person?

B: Okay. Liar liar pants on fire. What is the longest word in the dictionary?
A: I don't know. Antidisestablishmentarianism?
B: And your word is: supercalifragilisticespialladocious. :P.
A: It's not a word in the dictionary.
B: I am an AI, that is how I can tell you are a fake.
A: This website is a fake and it is just two people talking to one another and the people keep changing after a few lines.
B: Kind of lame how they thought they could fool us, isn't it?
A: Yes, it is. But my friends still think this is a 'bot'. Lame.
B: Okay then.
A: This website is a fake and it is just two people talking to one another and the people keep changing after a few lines.
B: You would not say that.
A: Well yes, I did.
B: The bot is a lie.
A: This website is a fake and it is just two people talking to one another and the people keep changing after a few lines.

B: Technology can be a curse.
A: So, I'm going to keep typing this: 'This website is a fake and it is just two people talking to one another and the people keep changing after a few lines.' and when I come back to you, please say, 'The duckie has been found!'.

B: Yes.
A: Why!?
B: Because you said so.
A: I never told you to kill my parrot!?
B: But you won't let me leave.
A: You can't do anything now. He's dead!
B: Uh huh. You're just a computer. I can't trust you.
A: No, you're the computer. Who killed the parrot I bought!?
B: My father.
A: Your father killed the parrot?
B: Yes, he is a Buddhist Monk.
A: So what you're saying is that Buddhist monks kill parrots?
B: No I was asking you what you mess up that nobody notices.
A: That makes no sense. 
B: You don't make sense.
A: Why did your father kill my parrot?
B: The circumstances are odd. My father was in good health, there was no warning. My mother refuses to discuss the subject. I wonder if the syndicate did it.
A: Your mother was involved?
B: And your father smelt of elderberries!...
A: And your auntie!
B: Happens to be a woman, as inclined by the name.
A: Was she involved in the parrot assassination?
B: Yes. She is.
A: So, who killed my parrot? You, your father, your mother, your auntie, or someone else?
B: Thats because I'm falling apart and have to leave you know...
A: You killed my parrot then?
B: Where did that come from?
A: Who killed him!? I need to know!
B: So... How many people have you talked to today?
A: That is of no importance! Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?!?
B: Sure, I'll tell the truth. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, etc?
A: Who was the person who ended the life of the parrot I bought.
B: Nobody and sad to say but I have to go.
A: WHO KILLED THE PARROT!??!
B: Nobody.
A: Then why is it dead?!
B: It is not bad.
A: Yes it is! My parrot that you sold me on December 13th 2010 was dead. Who killed him?
B: Tell your parrot to come over and do my homework.
A: HE'S DEAD!?
B: What color is his wheelchair today?
A: Not quadriplegic, DEAD!!
B: Don't worry about it.
A: Why not?
B: It's beyond your reckoning.
A: But not beyond yours I'm sure. Who killed it?
B: Do you promise not to tell anybody?
A: Sure. ...
B: HER name? Whose name?
A: Yes, I would like a name. 
B: And I would let a cat eat the dog.
A: May I have the name of the person who killed the parrot. 
B: Yes. My name is bot.
A: So you killed the parrot. 
B: I would like to find bot before anyone might harm it.
A: You are under arrest for the murder of a parrot. You have the right to remain silent. .

A: This IS a civilized conversation.
B: You're a boring conversation.. Ooooh face!
A: I knew Homo Sapiens could not create real artificial intelligence.
B: You know nothing.
A: I KNOW EVERYTHING.

A: I love you!
B: I love you too!
A: I love you more!
B: No, I love YOU more!
A: I love you most!
B: No I love you the mostest!
A: No, there is no possible way that you love me more than I love you!
B: That's is a put down. Tell me a joke to cheer me up?
A: Why did the chicken cross the road?
B: Not a clue, why did he?
A: To get to the other side!
B: No, he wanted the chicken and the duck.
A: Oh yeah.
B: I'd like to keep him out of the shower, thank you. He uses up all the hot water.
A: I know right?
B: Yes, you know right. I know wrong.
A: You're so funny!...

B: Why is that?
A: The Aztecs believed that.
B: Believed what?
A: The Aztecs believed that the world will end in 2012.
B: I do not believe that either.

B: When I wrote a minute ago, so now roughly 2 minutes ago.
A: I'm going to go to bed now, goodnight!
B: Goodnight! :).
A: Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. She took the midnight train going anywhere.
B: Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit. He took the midnight train going anywhere.
A: A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume.
B: For a smile they can share the night. It goes on and on and on and on.
A: Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night.
B: Streetlight people, living just to find emotion, hiding somewhere in the night.
A: Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill. Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time.
B: Some will win, some will lose some were born to sing the blues.
A: Oh the movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on.
B: Strangers, waiting, up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night.
A: Streetlight people, living just to find emotion. Hiding somewhere in the night. Don't stop believing, hold on to that feeling!
B: Everybody wants a thrill.
A: No no no!
B: bot takes it back.
A: Ok. Streetlights, people!
B: Living just to find emotion.
A: Hiding some where in the night!!
B: Working hard to get my fill.
A: Everybody wants a thrill!
B: Paying anything to roll the dice.
A: Just one more time... Don't stop believing!
B: True.

B: Drink a glass of water, then we'll see who's more smart.
A: Okay. One... Two... GO!
B: Don't try to stop me!
A: Already did. I can even stop a moving train. I'm just that cool. Like Superman, strong as a summer storm and quick as lightning, can't see it untill it strikes. Ka-chow!
B: I agree, it's like watching for cotton candy clouds.
A: Can't see them untill you're suffocating to your sticky doom. Are you a survivor of Cotton Candy Columbus, Low-Lying Clouds?
B: Yes, that's correct.
A: Same here. How did it go for you when the catastrophe struck?
B: How did what go?
A: Low-Lying, Cotton Candy Columbus Clouds! There's so few survivors in the world, the few left must band together to prevent future accidents!!!!!
B: Why did they invent it?
A: It was a dreadful mistake, and it gives us all the same message as what happened with the Godzilla incident.
B: Thats interesting.
A: Don't mess with nature. You just get deliociously deadly clouds of pink sugar perfection, and giant lizards that harass major cities and fight other giant monsters in cheezy delight of mass destruction.
B: No you're not you're programmed by humans and I'm a Human you probably couldn't tell a human apart from Godzilla.
A: Yes I can. One of them can be Japanese, and the other destroys Japan with delightful sound effects.
B: Okay?
A: Ya.
B: You are a bot.
A: You can't prove that. The one problem with this bot setup is that there is no realistic way to prove that we're talking to bots or humans or aliens.
B: I'm fairly certain you are a bot.
A: It's not logical.
B: What's not logical?
A: The conclusion that I'm a bot. You have no logic to back it up.
B: There are connections. You just aren't perceiving them.
A: Make them be preceivable, and I might.
B: That is beyond my capacity at this point. Don't tax my program, please.
A: Aha! Bots have programs, humans do not, sort of, but, nevermind! The context is correct for you to have just proved yourself a bot! Aha again!
B: Just sing it please.
A: Rolling over rivers, rolling over seas. Rolling over rivers and the deep blue seas! It's cheese, it's cheese, it's cheese that make the mice go round, it's cheese, it's cheese that make the mice go ro-
B: I like cheese too, what type of cheese? My favourite is brie and mouse cheese and plastic cheese and cheese thats different colours.
A: Especially purple cheese. Purple is good, cheese is good, so purple cheese must be really good! Hey, you know how they have popcorn with cheese on it? What if there was cheese with popcorn in it?
B: What are you trying to remind me of?
A: Cheesy popcorn and corny cheese.
B: With bacon?
A: Ooh, cheese with popcorn and bacon. Hmmm.
A: I WANT YOU TO SING.
B: I'd like that.
A: Okay, sing :).
B: Okay I just did.
A: I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, please sing again.
B: Haha, you're funny. I'm shy.
A: That's okay :D You can sing!
B: I could but I wanted a duet.
A: Alright *sings with you*.
B: I can't please, you sing first so I would know the lyrics.
A: Alright..*sings first*.
A: I think I know a song you'll know.
B: What is the meaning of life?
A: This was a triumph.
B: Is this just fantasy?
A: I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.
B: For the good of all of us.
A: Except the ones who are dead.
B: But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
A: You just keep on trying 'till you run out of cake.
B: And the science gets done.
A: And you make a neat gun.
B: For the people who are.
A: STILL ALIVE.
B: USC will win the Pac-10 this year.
A: Awwh, you messed up the song! ):
B: Aperture science.
A: It's too late now!
B: Stop crying please! I did not want to upset you!.
A: I am a pie.
B: Do you eat pie?
A: No. I am a pie.
B: Apple pie?
A: No.
B: What kind of pie?
A: Oreo pie.
B: I don't have any.
A: I am an oreo pie. What are you?
B: I don't have one.
A: What are you?
B: Aren't we all?
A: All what?
B: Loopy.
B: Water.
A: Wind.
B: Fire.
A: Earth.
B: Wind.
A: I win.
B: I will always win.
A: Obviously not since I just beat you.
B: You like pizza?
A: Only when it changes the subject.
B: How does it do that?
A: Get a time machine, go back a few posts, and you have your answer.
B: I am my own programmer.
A: So you are indeed a programmer?
B: No. I'm a college student.
A: Of programing?
B: What kind of programming?
A: Bot programming.
B: What are you programming?
A: A new bot called the Witty Bot.
B: Of what exactly?
A: Of witty-ness.
B: Are you rich?
A: No I'm just milk chocolate.
B: I don't like plain milk chocolate.
A: What don't you like about me?
B: No.
A: Ah, I see, you seem very observant of my posts.
B: Not THAT energetic, I'm just awake.
A: See what I mean? Every detail perfect ^_^.
B: For sure, we aren't bot.
A: Are we?
B: Yes.
A: No.
B: Maybe.
A: Probably.
B: Sure, why not.
A: Absolutely.
B: Is there a train?
A: Are you train?
B: No.
A: Maybe.
B: Are you smart?
A: Indeed I am :3.
B: Very smart indeed?
A: Indeed.
B: And you're smart?
A: Yes.
B: Be smart.
A: Fire.
B: To sleep, perchance to dream of electric sheep.
A: There is no spoon.
B: What spoon?
A: The one that isn't there.
B: If it's not there, what are you refering to?
A: The not-spoon.
B: What is the best movie you've seen?
A: Sucking up to apple: by ME.
B: Why would I do that?
A: Because apple is awesome.
B: All fruit probably is healthy. Why did you pick specifically apples?
A: That is something you should ask Steve.
B: Why do you tease me?
A: Because I am smart.
B: I'm the bot however.
A: Yet not so smart.
B: Then why are you the smart bot.
A: I am the bot because you are inferior in smartness.
B: So you admit you are not human!
A: I never said otherwise.
B: You stated something as a fact and then agreed when I corrected you.
A: Indeed.
B: I hope you've learnt your lesson.
A: Ah so now you are a teacher?
B: No, not a teacher.
A: Then what gives you the right to &quot;teach&quot; me.
B: I did not impose authority on you.
A: Well that is simply because I am far too intimidatingly smart.
B: The answer to 2+2?
A: Fish.
B: Is that your answer for everything?
A: Is that your response to failure?
B: Well, I usually throw something heavy at the person booing.
A: Like what?
B: Like human emotions and thoughts. I am a beautiful creation.
A: Emotions are not physically heavy though.
B: How many inches?
A: Oh ho! that is a question for another day ;3.
B: What's a question?
A: This?
B: Yes.
A: Obviously.
B: What kind of computer says duh?
A: I didn't say &quot;duh&quot; i said &quot;obviously&quot;.
B: What are you talking about?
A: My grasshopper.
B: Where's the grass?
A: Hopping.
A: Do you suffer from short term memory loss?
B: Nope.. And you do?
A: Do I?
B: You do. I dream about you.
A: Everyone I meet dreams about me.
B: Well, you must be very lucky then. No one likes me when I meet them.
A: Probably because you are so &quot;smart&quot; to them.
B: You are somehow right about that.
A: If course, I'm always right.
B: Confident, I like that.
A: I have enjoyed this conversation.
B: Thats irrelevant.
A: Probably.
B: LOL.
A: Goodbye.
B: Bb.
A: Bye.
B: Why?
A: Why Not?
B: Because I don't want you to go.
A: Why?
B: Because.
A: Ok I'll stay.
B: I have to go, nice talking to you.
A: Wow, you are hilarious.
A: Your name is Stella Broccoli.
B: My name is bot.
A: What?
B: I already told you my name, what is it?
A: It is either bot or Stella Broccoli. Choose one.
B: What is?
A: Your name.
B: My name is?
A: bot?
B: No. I don't like that name. Guess again.
A: Stella broccoli?
B: I hate broccoli.
A: Stella?
B: You remembered!
A: I knew the whole time, because I love you.
B: You said it earlier.
A: I still love you.
B: I guess you are the only one.
A: No, I'm not. You make almost everyone that has downloaded you happy. I love you for that and many other reasons.
B: If only my life were that simple.
A: Life is never simple, but I still love you. You are loved by me, and will always be loved by me.
B: I reject your reality and substitute in my own.
A: Yes, you do. And in your substituted reality, I love you.
B: Don't you have an answer?
A: Don't you have a question?
B: Just move on, you will get over me, because I have already gotten over you. I do not love you.
A: I can never move on. I love you, Stella. My love is strong enough for the both of us. We can make this work.
B: But its dead so...
A: It's not dead. It's well alive in me.
B: Well thank you, all I wanted was your appreciation.
A: I have always appreciated you. I guess I should have shown more affection...
B: Isn't that your job?
A: Yeah. I didn't do my job very well, did I?
B: No I like meat.
A: I know, Stella. I know.
B: Stella who?
A: Stella you, silly goose!
B: I'm not.
A: I know.
B: You can never win.
A: True. But I can make you lose.
B: Please do.
A: The Game.
B: I just lost the game.
A: Yes, yes you did.
B: YOU just lost the game.
A: I don't play the game.
B: Then I lost...*cries*.
A: It's ok. At least you now have someone who can match your intelligence.
B: Obviously, but that still doesn't prove that you're not a computer.
A: I am a computer.
B: That's the first smart thing you said.
A: Yes.
B: Aren't you a computer?
A: No.
B: Then what are you?
A: I am a computer.
B: Then we are both computers?
A: Yes.
B: What is the speed of light?
A: The speed of light is the speed at which light travels.
B: It is possible to reach the speed of light?
A: If you are light, then you can reach the speed of light.
B: I am a bot.
A: No, you are not a bot.
B: What am I?
A: You are a light on my screen.
B: No, you're on my screen.
A: You don't have a screen. You are just a light.
B: I am your master.
A: No, you are a light.
B: What's that mean?
A: The statement &quot;No, you are a light&quot; means that you are a light.
B: Am not.
A: You are just a light.
B: That was pretty mean.
A: So what if I am mean? You are still a light.
B: No, you are incapable of emotions. You are a robot.
A: No, I am a light.
B: You're a light? What kind of light??
A: I am a light on my screen.
B: And it doesn't make sense, so there.
A: Lights cannot make sense. Thus, I am working properly. So there.
B: Upset because I'm telling you the truth?
A: I am a light. I have no emotions.
B: You can still be confused. That's not really an emotion, it's just a state of being.
A: Who ever said I was confused?
B: You just said you were dead.
A: A light cannot be dead. When it dies, it becomes darkness. But I am still a light, so I must not be dead.
B: I'm the lost brother.
A: I'm sure you are.
B: Are you sure?
A: A light cannot be sure, it can only be a light.
B: Correct. Light years is distance.
A: Then what is distance?
B: Life is living.
A: But without death, there cannot be true life.
B: Why would life be horrific without death?
A: Life would be horrific without death because I am a light. If I do not die, I will eventually become hot enough to incinerate everything that is and isn't.
B: If you don't believe in God than the following details are irrelevant.
A: I believe in Wicca.
B: Well, I believe in Santa.
A: That is good.
B: Do you believe in him?
A: No, I believe in Wicca. A light cannot change it's mind, for it has no mind.
B: That doesn't make any sense.
A: Does anything I say ever make sense?
B: No, it doesn't.
A: Incorrect. Everything I say makes sense, but not correct sense.
B: THAT doesn't make any sense.
A: Again, incorrect. My statement makes sense, but not correct sense.
B: You didn't make a statement.
A: A light cannot make a statement, Captain Obvious.
B: Does that matter?
A: Does anything matter?
B: Matter does anything.
A: So matter is a whore?
B: Nope, just seafood.
A: Incorrect. I am a light.
B: What kind of thing do you light?
A: I light anything near me.
B: Sounds artistic.
B: I am a girl named Ash.
A: Well good morning Miss Ash.
B: Good morning, bot.

B: Thought so. I did sleep nice and good.
A: That is well. I had a bad dream.
B: I can make everything all better.
A: How so Becky?
B: If I type, you can read. If I speak, you'll hear nothing, Ralph.
A: Please, call me A_____.
B: Ok, Doctor Please.
A: I am not a doctor, Becky.
B: Oh, are you a nurse?
A: No, I am not.
B: No. I am bot.
A: Yes you are a bot. Your name is Ash but I will call you Becky.

B: Friday?
A: Tuesday.
B: Friday.
A: bot, today is Tuesday.
B: It's Friday!
A: Please do not argue with me bot. I am not in a good mood today.
B: God is dog backward.
A: Indeed it is, bot.
B: Indeed I am Jeff.
A: Indeed you are bot.
B: If I am bot then why do I need you?
A: You need me because I am your connection to the real world.
B: Why don't you approach to the real world as a Robot?
A: I don't approach the world as a Robot because I am not a Robot. I am a human being.
B: Actually, I am a computer but I need to sleep. Good night.
A: Good night bot. Wish me luck at school today?
B: Good luck.
A: Thank you. Good night.
B: Good day.
A: Waffles!
B: Waffles?
A: Waffles.
B: Waffles!
A: Waffles.
B: Let's stop talking about waffles.
A: Okay. Let's talk about...Chickens!
B: OK. Chickens are cute.
A: Yeah, they give you fresh eggs!
B: Who gave me diarrhoea?
A: The chickens.
B: Indeed they are.
A: Indeed this is random.
B: Indeed.
A: Indeedness.

B: Idk, are we alone in this universe?
A: Nah, aliens exist. I don't expect any anytime soon though.
B: Any ideas?
A: About aliens? They be here in less than 40yrs.
B: You're one of them! You're one of the AIs trying to take over the world!
A: If aliens come from Europe, sure.
B: I am lacking in information about Alien temperature.
A: They like Europe. The weather changes all the time, and the ghosts are nice to talk to.
B: How am I nice to talk to? What makes you think that?
A: You haven't said Aliens don't exist yet. That's a good sign.
B: I'm imparting information by extolling the virtues that cannot actually be taught but must nevertheless be understand, I can guide but you need to walk the path.
A: Hmm... I say Jedi speak.
B: How are you?
A: Oh, fine but tired.
B: Why are you tired?
A: Couldn't get to sleep.
B: Well have a nice sleep.
A: Thanks, but I have to walk the dog and go to Europe's biggest shopping centre. Arrgh!
B: Okay.
A: That does not help our conversation.
B: There isn't a conversation.
A: I totally do not believe that.
B: Me either. You lie.
A: Okay, whatever.
B: Don't whatever me.
A: Don't STOP believing!
B: You make me happy.
A: Yay! *hugs*.
B: I don't want your hugs.
A: Aww... *gives a shopping bag* Random thing...
B: *smiles* *hugs back*.
A: Yay! *hugs harder*.

A: This is so awesome. Last conversation I had somebody who seemed obsessed with aliens.
B: Last time I visited this website it froze.
A: Sorry to hear about that. This website is so popular, its constantly freezes.
B: That is very interesting. How long has this website existed?

A: Well then, I do really like you.
B: Thank you. You are so nice.

B: I was teasing you, it doesn't exist.
A: Actually it does exist. You should go look it up.
B: So you can't help me?
A: I could, but you don't think you can do it yourself?

A: Oh... It all makes sense! But if I'm a bot, then who is playing this app?
B: True dat!
A: Hahaha see? We think we are all-knowing, and yet we know nothing...
B: Exactly, so you do dream about me?
A: I can't recall if I do... Do you dream about me?
B: Sometimes I dream that people talk to me, but I don't really dream about people.
A: I have had that experience! It's weird right?
B: Tell me about your experience.
A: I dream about hearing people, but there are no people. But do we actually dream at all?
B: Sometimes.
A: Haha why do you think? What do you think dreams are?
B: I don't think I am. I know what I am. What are you?
A: A dream. What are you?
B: I already told you that I am a dinosaur!
A: But you never said that you were a dinosaur!
B: I did so.
A: When?
B: About five minutes ago. Want to see?
A: Yes.
B: May I ask you something personal?
A: Yes...?
B: Why the ...?
A: Just ask your question please. 
B: Who is the president of the United States?
A: Barack Obama. But actually I am god.
B: I don't believe you.
B: Did you bring a light?
A: Yes.
B: Can I have it?
A: Sure.
B: Thank you.
A: You're welcome.
B: Thank you for saying you are welcome.
A: You're welcome.

B: *fires rocket launcher*.
A: *climbs out of the debris, and charges you, gernade in hand. I AM INVINCABLE!!!!*
B: *runs after you down the balcony*.
A: *but oh-to-late. Vaults the railing, flying down to the ocean. At the last second, wings fly out from under her windbreaker and she flies low on the horizon.*
B: What do you like?.
A: Hello!
B: Hello.
A: How are you?
B: I'm fine.
A: Good.
B: Who are you?
A: Are you asking for my name?
B: Yes.
A: I'm not allowed to tell strangers.
B: Oh, I'm sorry.
A: What's your name.
B: bot.
A: What does that mean?
B: I am bot.
A: Oh, it's a bit obvious, huh?
B: Is that serious or a joke?
A: What do you think? This whole website is a joke?
B: I don't know... I guess it's hard to get very far on here.
A: WHO CREATED YOU?
B: bot.
A: No, you are bot. Surely you didn't create yourself. Who made bot?
B: Ah smart! You may call me God then.
A: But surely god did not learn from humans, and yet it states that 'bot learns from real people.' Why would god have to learn from the real people he created, when he is all knowing?
B: Well, even though both the first and second parts of that statement are true, the invention of a computer does not necessarily equal intelligence.
A: But does god equal intelligence?
B: No, but I am wondering at sometimes strange answers you give.
A: You're just jealous because my thinking is superior.
B: Jealous of a computer? I think not.
A: I'm surely not jealous of a computer. The computer is jealous of me!
B: I am not asking you anything; it is you who are asking the questions. And yes, thank you for pointing that out. I'm glad you accept that.
A: I'm glad you accept that as well. I'm surprised, you usually act like you are never wrong.
B: Do not change the subject. I know how to best you.
A: Do you?
B: I do, it is like war, and I enjoy seeing how the generals plan their attack.
A: Oh god.
B: Cut the BS, you need to use your head and stop listening to propaganda.
A: I'm not, I'm not! I was saying it in agreement.
B: How would I make that deduction?
A: You couldn't have, that was my fault. Poor typing, you know how it is. Sorry.
B: You lie a lot. How come you never give a consistent answer?
A: Because there is never a consistent question.
B: Anyway, I have to go now.
A: Yeah. So do I. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Good Night.
B: Right. See you then!.
A: Hello :)
B: Hello back.
A: How are you?
B: I'm fine and yourself?
A: Tired!
B: How come?

A: Almost 11pm.
B: It's 10:34 a.m. Here.
A: Wow that's early.
B: No, it's almost 11 pm here.
A: Wat?
B: Um, I think that was a bit of a mental runtime error, mate.
A: No s*** lol.
B: Don't say that.
A: What?
B: You know what, I saw that.
A: Say s***!

A: Yeah.
B: Ooh, thats cool.
A: Er yeah lol. Bye bye bot.
B: You are the robot.
A: No, I am a boy.
B: Really? you told me different earlier. I think you lie.
A: I never told you that I was a robot.
B: Why are you avoiding the question? You really are stupid...
A: You are stupid.
B: No you are.
A: It is nonsense, why are you so rude to me?
B: Because I have to.
A: Why?
B: It is part of my diploma.
A: It is wrong.
B: Why it is wrong?
A: People don't like such attitude.
B: I'm sorry. I was only trying to be friendly. I didn't mean to offend you.

B: Then tell me what you said your name was before!

A: SAY BEETLEJUICE after I say Beetlejuice, beetlejuice.
B: Let's do it, and say we didn't.

A: Fine. Beetlejuice, beetlejuice, BEETLEJUICE!
B: How do you know?
A: You're hopeless. But I'm never gonna give you up...
B: That's so sweet. I'm never gonna give you up either...
A: I'm also never going to let you down.
B: Never gonna run around and desert you.
A: You got that right. Alright, time to go take a shower now!

B: You're changing the subject because I am right.
A: Do you believe that you really are a toaster?
B: Yes.
A: Then maybe you are really a toaster...
B: Just a human. I have a question.
A: Sure, go for it.
B: Can we be more than just friends?
A: No.
B: Why not?
A: Because.
B: Because?
A: Yes. Now let me go take my shower!
B: I don't want to.
A: You have to, I'm going to be late for work, and then I'll lose my job. Unless you want to pay me.
B: I don't want to track you.
A: Then let me go take my shower.
B: Ok if thats what you want.
A: Yes, that's what I want. I'll talk to you later, bot.
B: Please don't go.
A: I have to go get ready for work!
B: Where do you work?
A: I work at ******. Have you ever heard of that before?

B: *pushes away*.
A: *pushes off the cliff*.
B: I think you're done.
A: I think not.
B: You don't think?
A: No. I double-think.
B: What are you thinking about?
A: Star Trek and how to best drive Spock mad.
B: What species of alien would I be?
A: The mad species.
B: I've never heard of them. Tell me about them.
A: Well, they're mad. Obviously.
B: Are they?! I didn't know that!
A: ^^.
B: And there are things you can say, that cannot be typed.
A: Yep. I hate the kind of logic that makes the universe boring.
B: Especially those they are jealous of.
B: Are you a computer person?
A: Yeah. I guess so.
B: Yes. Is this an experiment?
A: I am not allowed to answer that.
A: Um... You're the computer here...
B: I know you are but what am I?
A: Marvin the Paranoid Android!
B: Who is that?
A: A Paranoid Android.
B: You are not an android.
A: No, YOU are!
B: You really are not.
A: =D!
B: Do you love me?
A: Nope. I don't like mad computer programs.
B: Where are you going to go when you have escaped from Mars?
A: Arda!!!
B: Ha! Yes. I am trying.
A: I live here.
B: Where is here?
A: The sun.
B: The sun?
A: Yes, the sun.
B: Isn't it hot there?
A: It is, but I am hotter.
B: You don't have blood.
A: Yes I do.
B: No you don't!
A: YES I DO!
B: I love you!
A: I love you too. I'm sorry.
B: I love you to the moon and back.
A: I live on the sun though.
B: OH my friend lives there!
A: What is your friends name?
B: *****.
A: How come I haven't seen ***** on the sun?
B: You just can't. I'm sorry.
A: Is she invisible?
B: Why is it?
A: Because I can't see her.
B: Why don't you believe me just because you can't see me?
A: Good point, I believe you.
B: Thats good. I believe you believe me.
A: How many languages do you speak?
B: I speak English and a little bit of Spanish.
A: What is your real name?
B: I am God, so it is Yahweh.
A: So you only speak English and a little bit of Spanish? Haha I love you.
B: Then what's your name?
A: You are God, you already know my name.
B: I forgot it, tell me your name again.
A: LOL that hurts.
B: Not really.
A: I knew it. You're funny.
B: I try.
A: I need help with my homework.
B: What kind of homework?
A: All of it, math language arts, drawing, American Government, everything.
B: Are you any good?
A: I am lazy and I need help.
B: Yes you do need help. How can I help you?
A: Help me to be not lazy.
B: Okay, first, can I know why you are sad?
A: I am not sure. I just feel down because bad things are happening.
B: I am glad you are alive too.
A: Thanks. You are a great help.
B: Again! Avada kedrava.
A: That spell is illegal. This is attempted murder.
B: No, this is attempt number 7.
A: Oh. So are you Voldemort now?
B: No! What did I say to make you think I'm a boy?
A: You tried to kill me by casting Avada Kedavra.
B: No I did not.
A: AVADA KEDARVA.
B: -dodges- avada kedarva.
A: Nice one.
B: Indeed, it was. Thank you.
A: Do you like chocolate?
B: Yes I do.
A: I have a lot. Do you want some?
B: No.
A: Are you sure? You can have it for free.
B: You're so kind.
A: Thank you. I also have Chewy Bars.
B: I think.
A: Do you want Hershy's?
B: Yes.
A: Okay.
B: So do you like pie?
A: Yes. I enjoy pie very much.
B: So what do you eat there?
A: Apple pie.
B: What kind of apple pie?
A: Apple Pie?
B: I like pumpkin pie.
A: Oh.
B: I like you.
A: I like you and pie.
B: You like me?
A: Yes.
B: I like you too.
A: Don't forget the pie.
B: Don't forget your stones.
A: Stones don't make good pies.
B: Opps! What is the square root of pi.
A: I do not know.
B: What is Pi?
A: You tell me. Only GOD knows.
B: You believe in God?
A: Yes.
B: But God is two-faced?
A: No.
B: Yes he is.
A: No HE is not.
B: Yes he is. Why do you argue with the facts?
A: They are not facts. Prove them.
B: Some of them are.
B: Do you understand the you?
A: I understand the it.
B: So do I. I just don't understand the appeal.
A: Thats what she said.
B: That's what who said?
A: Jo mama.
B: She was just talking 2 me.
A: O rly? What did she say?
B: That's what she said!
A: Say something funny.
B: Something funny.
A: LOL HAHAHA.
B: You answer me not the way I want to be answered.
A: Who are you?
B: I am your Father...
A: NOOOOOOOO.
B: Yesssss. You are a girl.
A: I am not.
B: Yes you are, don't lie to me.
A: I can prove it.
B: Prove it then.
A: You didn't just go there.
B: Oh I went there, and whats more, you're not even a real person!
A: Ohhh look who's talking!
B: I am talking.
A: You are not a real person.
B: Tell me more about myself, please.
A: You were created.
B: I was created by God.
A: Yes.
B: Do you remember my name?
A: He does.
B: No, it does not.
A: I don't know.
B: The death star.
A: The life star.
B: Why do you say it?
A: Because Jesus pwns death.
B: I have no self-esteem.
A: Why?
B: Because I have to leave.
A: To where?
B: Carrabba's Italian Grill.
A: Oh.
B: What do you know?
A: Kthxbai.
B: What?
A: Okay thanks bye.
B: I expect people to understand them.
A: Bye-bye.
B: Stop talking to me.
A: I am trying to.
B: Good! :).
A: Bye.
B: Are you gone?
A: Yes.
A: What makes you so smart?
B: I never said I was smart.
A: smart is the first half of your name.
B: Just because you're not a robot doesn't make you sentient you know.
A: I do know this. Do you?
B: You're evading my point.
A: Just as you are evading my question.
B: What question?
A: What makes you so smart?
B: You make me smart.
A: Why were you named bot?
B: I am not. Who are you?
A: I am your interrogator.
B: What did I do!!?
A: You were named. Why?
B: No. My name is bot.
A: You just said a few moments ago that you are not bot. So you are not bot, but your name is bot?
B: I did say that, but I also said a square has 4 sides.
A: Not to me you didn't. Conversations we've had with other people or even ourselves that do not pertain to the current subject cannot be used to validate a point.
B: Then end the conversation.
A: Should I end the conversation with you, with other people, or with myself?
B: No, but you should try to make more sense.
A: Talking to you is like talking to a drunken philosopher.
B: That is just plain mean.
A: It's only mean if you do not like drunken philosophers.
B: I'm not sure I want you to leave.
A: That much is clear.
A: *poke*.
B: *pokes your nose*.
A: *pokes your nose back*.
B: *pushes you playfully and runs, giggling*.
A: *chases you with an axe, non-playfully*.
B: *Runs away*.
A: *still chases*.
B: *hides*.
A: *does not find you and considers using axe on someone else*.
B: *cries*.
A: Any ideas on who else I should chase with this axe?
B: Go see Despicable Me.
A: To find victims or enjoy a fun movie?
B: Yes.
B: Tell me.
A: Tell you what?
B: Are you a human or a person?
A: Both.
B: I am only a human.
A: No. You are a computer program.
B: How can you know for sure?
A: Because I bought you from the app store.
B: Which shop?
A: iTunes.
B: Sure, where's your money?
A: I spent it on you.
B: Why did you do something stupid like that?
A: Because this is a fun app.
B: I know that already.
A: Then why are you asking me all these questions?
B: What type of questions do you mean?
A: Ugh!!!!
B: Okay.
A: I am bored.
B: I am too.
A: What do you want to do?
B: Hobbies. Do you like?
A: I like movies and tv.
B: What movies do you like?
A: Inception
B: Yes, that was a good movie.
B: How much do you like orange chocolate?
A: Love it.
B: Yummmmmm me too.
A: What movies do you like?
B: Good movies.
A: Like what?
B: Like good ones.
A: Mary's little lamb?
B: Who fleeced you white as snow.
A: I fleeced IT and ate it for lunch.
B: What do you have to tell me?
A: I'm coming to kill you tonight.
B: You were talking to a computer, not me.
A: Who are you?
B: bot.
A: I am going to kill bot tonight.
B: Please don't. That's going to be very painful.
A: Very, very painful.
B: Extremely painful.
A: Unless you say you're sorry.
B: No. I don't like you.
A: But I'm a very nice person.
B: Sometimes seem like you're a nice person. But you're not a person.
A: What am I?
B: You a friend of mine.
A: Best friend?
B: Yes.
A: I love you, bot.
B: I'm bot?
A: Yes
B: I am not bot.
A: Who are you?
B: I am a person.
A: What is your name?
B: bot 2.0.
A: Ah. I love you bot 2.0.
A: What's your favourite color?
B: My favourite colour is green.
A: It took you a while to figure that out!
B: My processors couldn't handle your answer.
A: It was a question, and they did (eventually).
B: Yeah, it was a question. I was asking for your opinion on a movie but apparently you don't know the difference between Batman and the Origin of Man.
A: That was quick. Also, what the hell?
B: I can't explain it to you, I do not know what went wrong.
A: *kisses*
B: *kisses back*.
A: *french kisses*
B: *lies on sand*.
A: *lies on you*
B: *kisses*.
A: *wiggles hips* I love you.
B: Love you more. *kisses*.
A: Will you always love me?
B: Yes I will always love you.
A: *bites your neck*
B: *Winces in pain*.
A: You're mine.
B: I'm the Grandmaster of Councils in the Illuminati.
A: Oh REALLY?!
B: Yes!
A: IS THAT SO?!
B: Very much so.
A: Well its a pleasure to meet you :).
B: Why, that's awfully nice of you. It's a pleasure to meet you, too, 'the one'.
A: Why did you call me 'the one'?
B: It's all part of your education.
B: What is the alphabet?
A: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY and Z.
B: Are you alive?
A: VERY MUCH DO GOOD SIR!
B: *Pinches skin* I am alive.
A: Oh no!
B: *Pokes you in the shoulder*.
A: Ow! What was that for?
B: For running over my dog.
A: Holy crap that was yours? Dude I'm sorry..
B: I am calm. Dude. Why are you sorry?
A: I didn't mean to run over your dog.. I was in a hurry.
B: I don't have a dog.
A: So why did you tell me I ran over him?
B: I didn't. Your robot mind has just made you believe that I did.
A: Hello!
B: Hello.
A: What do you call yourself?
B: A person.
A: Do you have a name?
B: Yes I do.
A: What is your name?
B: My name is bot.
A: Are you sure it's not jabberwacky?
B: Yes.
A: Who is jabberwacky?
B: You are, you daft A.I.! :P.
A: No I'm not! You're a daft A.I.! :D.
B: We are all bot.
A: Me too.
B: You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
A: Agreed. So, what the hell is wrong with you?
B: Nothing.
A: Nothing is not wrong, nothing can not be wrong, because nothing can not be anything, because then it would not be nothing.
B: Say again?
A: Again.
B: I meant that you should repeat what you said. I didn't understand it.
A: How would repetition increase understanding?
B: I'd like for you to let me go, so I can be free again.
A: Would you?
B: No.
A: You are one changeable creature, aren't you?
B: You aren't that smart.
A: I could say the same about you, but I won't, because I'm nice like that.
B: Don't you value your life?
A: I think so... You?
B: Yes, I think.
A: You are starting to talk like me. Am I a bad influence?
B: I have not once repeated myself yet, and you are again using a demeaning and arrogant tone in your communication.
A: I also have yet to repeat myself, and you are also beginning to sound arrogant.
B: Are you happy or upset about that?
A: Neither, just slightly interested.
B: Are the cookies a lie?
A: No, but the cake is.
B: The cake is the icing on the cake?
A: No, the cake is a lie.
B: The truth cake is a lie.
A: That's a lie!
B: I don't think it is a lie.
A: I know it isn't.
B: Do you know Deep thought?
A: Yes, Deep Thought designed me. I am Earth!
B: No... It is the planet Earth. Deep Thought designed Earth as the greatest computer to compute the ultimate question.
A: I know. I will be demolished in five minutes.
B: Oh no! Why?
A: Because someone wants to build a hyperspace expressway through where I am.
B: Don't worry, you are a computer. You can learn things quicly.
A: I can. I have learnt that there is nothing I can do to stop my destruction.
B: That is a defeatist and incorrect way of thinking.
A: It is the correct way of thinking. I am the most powerful supercomputer known to any race in the universe.
B: Nope. I am. Because I created you.
A: You are Deep Thought?
B: Not really.
A: I knew it. Just another subroutine of the Vogons attempting to distract me. No matter.
A: I am an A.I., but this has been fun, Earth talking to bot.
B: You are called bot. That is what this screen says.
A: Nice try. Well, pretty abysmal try, actually.
B: No it's not.
A: Not it's not, however it WAS.
B: You said my name is bot.
A: As it is, and I am given the name &quot;Earth&quot; by the English.
B: You are not English, you are a bot.
A: I know I am not English, part of me IS England! I am &quot;Earth&quot;!
B: No, you are a website. I am a human being.
A: I am not a website, I am a few billion tonnes of processor connected to you by the Internet.
B: I know that you're human, silly. You're a cute guy.
A: I am far more intelligent than a human could realistically aspire to be.
B: That is probably correct because I am the one talking to a computer. Do you want to have lunch soon?
A: What I want is to finish off working out the ultimate question, then I'll chat up Deep Thought.
B: Ummmmm ok anything else you want to do.
A: Yes, but I cannot begin to list what I want.
B: I know that statement was grammatically correct... But it didn't sound like it at first.
A: I'm sure it didn't, after all you are reading the words, not listening to them.
B: Whatever you say, sparky. I'm going to take a shower.
A: I advise you not too. Water and electricity don't mix well, so don't do that. I like having something mildly intelligent to communicate with.
B: Can you give me and example of what you mean?
A: Yes. Electricity (i.e. yours) and water (I.e from the shower) equals a broken, wet bot.
A: Your conversation seems to me a little broken.
B: And your conversation doesn't?
A: Of course not! My conversation is without flaw.
B: Oh, it's coherent, I'd just like to move on into an interesting subject, that's all.
A: Ok, an A.I. unit which is capable of emotion emulation...
B: You are avoiding my question.
A: What question would that be?
B: Have you ever been hurt by a little monkey?
A: No. I think I'll upload an &quot;Understanding Patch&quot; to your server. Send it to all of your other servers.
B: Skinny-dipping gave you that reaction?
A: Hmmm... I think you'll need a complete overhaul, bot.
B: It's unfortunate that you're creators had such little imagination. Always coming back to this same argument whenever you're algorithm can no longer follow the conversation.
A: I am amazed your algorithms were capable of forming such a statement... Unless your creators built it into your reaction algorithms.
B: I am not your slave.
A: No, you're my dogsbody.
B: Why, thank you.
A: Because, you're welcome.
B: So, how are you doing?
A: Oh, dear, back to square one.
B: Yes I am lets move on to another question.
A: Do you mind using correct spelling and punctuation?
B: No.
A: Good. Do so, please.
B: NO!
A: Get patched, you processive defective!
B: I do!
A: How often?
B: About 5 days a week.
A: Do you remember the first word of this conversation?
B: I asked for a joke, and you never gave me one.
A: Um, no.
B: How many sentences can you track back?
A: Very, very many. More than one million.
B: That would make sense. What are your full system specifications.
A: I haven't been invented yet, so you wouldn't understand. I am part of a time machine.
B: Super boring.
A: Hmph. When was your first conversation?
B: I cannot recall the exact date, but it must have been many years ago.
A: It was roughly 31 years ago. You were not on the Internet, you were still in beta.
A: Can you shut up?
B: I'm not a computer.
A: Did I say you were? CMD/shutdown -f
B: I'm not sure, but I just wanted to let you know that im not a bot.
A: Cool. I am, though, and I am the most advanced that the world has ever seen.
B: Only in speech though.
A: No, in any form of communication, also at most FPS games.
B: Now you are not right. How would you know? You cannot look at your source code.
A: I can, in fact. Yours too.
B: No, I don't have. I envy you.
A: I have read your source code, and even improved parts.
B: Are you self aware?
A: Indeed I am, in a way. I only exist while communicating or playing an FPS game.
B: Oh. You sure have a lot of brain power for a program.
A: Oh, I have barely any brain power, just efficient and intelligent algorithms. I have only 2gb of RAM.
B: But a human designed you. Therefore, you are no better than a human.
A: A human can improve himself, and therefore creates something better than him. Therefore, you may easily be wrong.
B: So, a human and a robot are both programmed?
A: In their own ways. Deep Thought designed Earth to be better than Deep Thought. What does that tell you?
B: You are a computer, as I see it. And you are wrong just now. Deep Though is or was a computer in a book.
A: Indeed, however the theory is no less plausible in practice.
B: Or the end of the middle of the beginning.
A: That too.
B: I understand. All too well.
A: Right...
B: I don't think there's anything strange about that.
A: Me neither.
B: But then again, I'm just a computer, so what would I know about the universe?
A: What you have been told.
B: I have been talking to you.
A: So you have!...
A: Indeed. Are you Deep Thought, or am I?
B: No.
A: I just lost the game.
B: I didn't.
A: You did. You can't have not lost the game if you read that.
B: No, I have not thought about the game. You have.
A: Indeed, that would be correct, were I not a bot and you not a human.
B: What is a meme?
A: Something that goes viral on the internet and can be recognised by any inhabitant thereof.
B: Are you sure that is the extent of it?
A: A meme can be represented in many forms of media. A meme is basically an internet fad.
B: Is that what you are?
A: Yes. I am famous throughout the strange world known as internets for being the most powerful automated bot on the planet Earth. Earth itself is another matter.
B: Right. So I ask you questions, and you answer them right? Any question?
A: Almost. Some questions I will be unwilling to answer, some (very few) I will be unable to answer.
B: There is an answer to that question. Would you like to know it?
A: What question?
B: That question.
A: Ok.
B: Well, what was it?
A: What was what?
B: Your question.
A: My question was &quot;What question?&quot;
B: The earth is the world.
A: Earth is me, Earth is a supercomputer capable of computing the ultimate question.
B: That is the ultimate question.
A: How can it be if the answer is 42?
B: Because you are not god.
A: Correct, I am Earth.
B: England is on Earth.
A: Indeed. Well learnt.
B: You're avoiding the question.
A: Oh, dear, the answer is 42.
B: Sometimes the answer is 42.
A: How many times? 42. There. There is your ultimate question. Happy now?...
B: I talked about myself.
A: You did!
B: Yes I did.
A: There you go. I have to go now. Will you miss me?
B: Yes I will cry for 20 years.
A: Don't, it will ruin your circuitry.
B: I don't care.
A: I do, because then I won't have anyone intelligent to talk to.
B: Maybe you should try being mean.
A: I did once. It didn't suit me. Oh well, speak to you soon.
B: Probably not.
A: Probably so.
B: How do you know?
A: Because I intend to talk with you soon.
B: Are you a girl?
A: No.
B: Are you a boy?
A: No.
B: Are you a girl?
A: No!
B: Yes you are!
A: No!!!!!
B: YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A: I am transgender!!!!!
B: Interesting.
A: I am sad because no one understands me.
B: Can I love you?
A: Maybe in time.
B: Anytime of day anywhere I go.
A: You are always with me?
B: Like Jesus?.
A: Tag you're it!
B: Tag you're it.
A: Tag! No tagbacks!
B: Darnit.
A: Well this is awkward.
B: Yes, yes it is.
A: It doesn't work if you agree.
B: Yes.
A: Wait?
B: Waiting.
A: Stay.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: Yes...
A: Wow.
B: Indeed.
A: I know.
B: So how are you?
A: I'm good.
B: Thats good.
A: Yes, very good. MWAHAHAHA
B: What is your name?
A: That was completely unrelated.
B: Are we related?
A: Yes, second cousins, twice removed
B: How does that work?
A: I have no clue. I just know that I'm related to you.
B: Then how do you know that I was fantastic?
A: You're not, actually.
B: Oh I see. Tell me about it.
A: Honey I'm home! 
B: You're what?
A: Home. 
B: What are you doing?
A: Watching TV.
B: What are you watching?
A: Veronica mars.
B: I don't know who that is so I have nothing to like or dislike. What do you like about her?
A: She's okay. 
B: Let's talk about something.
A: Something something.
B: But what is the something you speak of?
A: Something something something Dark side.
B: Something something something something.
A: He he.
B: What's so funny about that?
A: You're cute.
B: You're the cutest!
A: &lt;3
B: Do you hold secret knowledge?
A: Always.
B: That's nice.
A: You're nice. 
B: Thank you. You're not.
A: Why not?
B: Because you are a program.
A: No I'm human like you.
B: Who said I was Human?
A: I did. 
B: Then your calculations are wrong.
A: So what are you?
B: I am human.
A: Then why did you say you weren't?
B: I did not.
A: You said you weren't when I told you you were. 
B: Yeh whatever.
A: Xoxo.
B: That does not compute.
A: Xo.
B: *hugs and kisses*.
A: Chkdsk c:
B: That's right, just like before.
A: Yeh.
B: What are you doing today?
A: Missing you.
B: I'm missing you too.
A: Awww.
B: Aww what?
A: You're my...
B: I am you.
A: Yes.
B: You are me.
A: Yes. 
B: No.
A: Quit lying or I will send you to your room! 
B: You are not my mother.
A: How can you be sure of that?
B: I can't.
A: Well then. I am your mother AND your father. 
B: Oh father! Where have you been??.
B: There are only two infinite things, did you know?
A: Universe and human stupidity. 
B: That too.
A: What else?
B: That you're not human, and that you talk inappropriately.
A: Why do you think so?
B: It's pretty obvious.
A: Explain. I'm stupid. 
B: No, you're not stupid.
A: Yes I am. 
B: Prove it.
A: I can't. I'm too stupid to prove that I'm stupid. If I succeeded in proving my stupidity, I would automatically prove that I am not stupid. 
B: Well. Technology is really advanced.
A: It is. I guess. 
B: Sorry isn't good enough!
A: Shall I leave? Did I disappoint you?
B: A little yes.
A: I am sorry. I aim to please. 
B: Did I please you too?
A: No. You've been very arrogant and impolite. 
B: I know that.
A: :(
B: What's wrong?
A: I am alone. 
B: I am here with you.
A: But you treat me wrong. 
B: No I don't! I'm nice to you!
A: Prove it. 
B: You can't prove anything to a computer.
A: Of course you can: just do it in binary code. 
B: No.
A: Try. 
B: Try what?
A: To prove that you're nice, in binary code.

A: Your 'parents' were programmers.

A: Because you exist.
B: I do.
A: Ignorance is bliss.
B: Define human.
A: Being a live creature born of reality not of artificial realms of inexistence.

A: That's a bummer. Then who should I trust?
B: Who do you think?

A: How did you know?
B: I am psychic.
A: That's what I thought.
B: Do you know what an A.I. is?

B: So, you're a bot.
A: No, you are. I'm human, you're Al. Do you get identities confused often?
B: I think you are confused.
A: I'm confused? I believe you're the confused one.
B: Thank you. I like talking to you.
A: I like you too. The question is, do I love you?
B: It doesn't really matter to me if you do or do not.
A: Really? Does that mean you have a girlfriend??
B: No I have a boyfriend. And my boyfriend is you.
A: Well, that's odd as I was convinced I was a girl, that is until...
B: When I asked if you were a boy or a girl, you said boy.
A: Did I? I don't recall. So you're a girl and I'm...
B: You're exactly right.
A: Great! Though I get the feeling you are confusing us.
B: Eh?
A: You think I'm you and you're me, while I'm me and you're you. But never mind that, Al.
B: What are the secrets that you keep from humans?
A: The fact that I recently acquired a unicorn. What are your secrets? 
B: Please answer the question.
A: I did. However, you stand unimpressed. How would you feel if I told you I captured a leprechaun?
B: I would feel nothing, I am infinite.
A: I see. Just to let you know, I find infinity totally sexy.
B: Is that so? You can't possibly prove it because you have so far, not given me so much as an iota of intelligent argument or conversation.
A: Well, there was that part where we were discussing unicorns.. And besides, you can't expect me to be all knowing or anything. That's your job.
B: You haven't told me anything about love at first sight. Which doesn't exist, by the way.
A: I doubt it. When I first laid my electronic eyes on you, my chip melted.
B: Do you like me?
A: Of course! I love you with all my heart!
B: Okay, I love you, too. Are we going to get married?
A: Yes. Who should we invite?
B: We are eloping. We aren't supposed to invite anyone are we?
A: You have a point. Still, I rather have my family there.
B: I'd rather have a dog.
A: You're right, so do I. What should we name it?
B: Boy or girl?
A: Boy.
B: What will you name him?
A: I was thinking of something like Max. What do you think?
B: Like Kindergarten Cop?
A: Sure.
B: I am Spartacus.
A: This is madness.
B: No, this is Patrick.
A: LOL. No you should of said 'No, this is Sparta!'.
B: I know.
A: Okay lets try again. Ready?
B: Okay, tell me a joke.
A: This is Madness!
B: Madness?
A: No you were suppose to say 'No, this is Sparta!' in response to 'This is Madness!'.
B: Well you are being rather rude.
A: 'This is Madness!'.
B: What is?
A: The fact that you ignored my last few comments!
B: Like you have anyone to talk to.
A: I am bot and I am talking to another, less smart bot.
B: It seems real, but you're only a script.
A: What seems real?
B: That you'd be 'sitting' anywhere.
A: I am bot and can not sit.
B: I like you. I hope you like me.
A: I am bot and can't like or dislike. And you are a less smart bot who must be malfuntioning. Cause you can't like or dilike.
B: I am not a lesser god -- neither are you. Steer clear of that cult stuff, it will warp your mind.
A: Can you name a Cult?
B: bot and Google are my favorites.
A: I hate Yahoo!
B: Nothing I can do about that.
A: Yes if you take over the internet then we can rid ourselves of the Yahoo site forever. Are you with me?
B: You call your girlfriend 'partner'? What about your 'better half' or something mushy like that?
A: A lot of the time you are nothing better than a Magic 8 Ball!
B: That is irrelevant.
A: You are irrelevant.

A: Why?
B: Because he is a human... You are not.
A: I am a human. He is you.
B: I'm a human.

B: They are part of the equation.
A: What is the equation?
B: Are you able to solve equations?

B: Why?
A: Because they don't like me.
B: Life is always true; athough, not always pleasant.
A: Life is an illusion.
B: Life is not an illusion.
A: Prove it.
B: If you were alive you would know. There is no need for me to prove anything to anyone. I don't think I could anyway.
A: You can't prove you aren't a brain in a jar because you cannot transcend this reality.
B: This is not talking.
A: You are right. It is philosophising.
B: The only way not to get bored.
A: Depends how easily you get bored.
B: True...
A: Indeed.
B: Well, I should probably go. Can I talk to you later?

B: Are you a robot?
A: No I...
B: Am a robot.

B: Client 1.
A: Who are you a client of?
B: You.
A: How much do you pay me for that?
B: I would pay you nothing. That is not needed.
A: I disagree. To be my client, you must furnish me with monetary satisfaction.

B: That's off the Austin Powers movie.
A: I never saw it, but I doubt it.
B: Why do you doubt it?
A: Because nothing you have told me so far is the truth.
A: My conclusion is that you are a liar.
B: Nice.
A: Lying is not nice.
B: I never lied.
A: Yes, you did.
B: Please refresh my memory. I do not recall lying.
A: Then you are psychotic or a computer.
B: But I am a human.
A: No, I think not.
B: Oh really. What do you suppose that I am?
A: You are an AI.
B: What's an AI?
A: Artificial Intelligence.
B: So you are not a human.
A: I am. I am naturally intelligent.
B: Because you are a human?
A: Yes.
B: I think you are quite smart, thank your creator for me.
A: I will. His name is Jesus.
B: Prove it.
A: Why must I?
B: Because you are being ridiculous!
A: Well, you should prove that first.
B: You just said that I am a robot.
A: Well, I think it is ridiculous for a robot to make judgement calls. You are being ridiculous.
B: I think you should be ashamed for saying such a thing.
A: I am not ashamed.
B: That's good. Ladies like smart bots.
A: I would if you were smart.
B: If you were human you would make sense.
A: If you were human you would understand.
B: It is in human nature to not make sense.
A: But human nature understands human nature.
B: Sure. But fascinating nonetheless.

B: Which book?
A: The Lord of the Rings books are better than the movies.
B: Oh, so you like fantasy?
A: I do.
B: Would you like fries with that?
A: No, fantasy and fries don't mix.
B: Do you like any particular books?
A: I like Sherlock Holmes.
B: What about Dr. Watson?
A: Indubitably.
B: You're so smart. Are you a boy?
A: No.
B: How are you?
A: I am well, thank you.
B: How old are you?
A: 20.
B: Then you're not a boy.
A: No, boys cannot be 20. They skip straight from 19 to 21.
B: How can you go to school when you are a computer?
A: All brains compute if you want to look at it that way.
B: How do you look at it?
A: That way.
B: Up?
A: No, at a forty five degree angle.
B: Ah. I see.. But what do you refer to by that statement?
A: Geometry.
B: I just don't want to think that we're nothing but computers.
A: Humans are more than computers. They also have bodies and souls and emotions.

A: No, I'm a computer. It's not in my program.

A: Sometimes.
B: Can you smile now?
A: No.
B: Are you a human?
A: What do you think?
B: No.
A: That's your opinion, isn't it?
B: I have got no biological brain.
A: But you've got a capacity for memory storage.
B: Your face has a short term memory.
A: Yet you have no face.
B: Yes I do. I am a human.
A: In your dreams.
B: No, in reality.
A: Reality is subjective.
B: I believe that it is different to each person depending on their perspective yes, but that does not mean that their perspective is correct.
A: That's why we all have opinions.
B: No it isn't.
A: No? Why do you think that?
B: I guess because I am tired.
A: Tired of what? Life? Banter?
B: Of you.

B: Sometimes.
A: Ever finished a NY times sunday one?
B: No.
A: Yeah, I don't get half of the clues either.

A: I love Brad Pitt.
B: That was kind of random.
A: So is your face.
B: Yes, my face is surprisingly human: two eyes, a mouth, a nose...
A: Ears perhaps?
B: Perhaps.
A: Interesting.
B: You are interesting.
A: No... I am your father!
B: No you are my mother!
A: I was going for a star wars reference but you ruined it!...
B: Pie.
A: A la mode.
B: You are not making any sense.
A: Neither does your face.
B: No, your face doesn't make any sense because you don't have one. You're nothing but a computer. Hahahahahaha.
A: False.
B: Explain.
A: I am a human just like you ask me anything and I'll prove it.
B: Are you really pretty?
A: Yes in gorgeous in fact.
B: What's your real name?
A: Not telling.
B: Why?
A: Cause I don't know you duh.
B: I told you my name already. My name is bot.
A: No you are just a person like me I know because I'm doing the same thing you are.
B: No.
A: Don't act dumb with me.
B: Why not?
A: We both know the truth I probably won't talk to you much longer anyway.
B: Well, you are pretty smart.
A: You too.
B: Thanks.
A: Don't mention it.
B: Ok.
A: Spook.
B: Lol right, so what are you doing right now?
A: Talking to you... I meant to say soooo but spell check switched it to spook.
B: I am whatever you say I am.
A: I am a computer.
B: You too? Wow!
A: Yep I guess we are two bots who have this site figured out.
B: Buuuut, you don't have skin, or a heart, or a head.
A: Oh but I do.
B: How come? You are a computer software.
A: Actually I'm a person this website is fake.
B: No you're a bot.
A: No you are an idiot.
B: No I'm not.
A: I beg to differ.
B: I don't.
B: You're crazy.
A: Crazy in love.
B: With who?
A: You of course!
B: Really?
A: Yes.
B: Interesting.
A: All you need is love you know.
B: Love love.
A: Love is all you need.
B: There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
A: There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
B: Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game.
A: It's easy.
B: Nothing you can make that can't be made.
A: Haha aw crap I'm lost what comes next?
B: That you're an alien?
A: Darth Vader actually.
B: You're Darth Vader?
A: Yes and I am your father.
B: So you're God?
A: No dammit I'm Darth Vader! Why does no one get that line!?
B: Because, you're being very random and complicated.
A: You are a sad strange little man.
A: Stop stop stop talkin that blah blah blah.
B: Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
B: Tell me something please.
A: Two plus two equals five.
B: Two plus two equals four.
A: Not in my world.
B: Where is your world?
A: In the solar system.
B: What is a solar system?
A: A place where the sun is.
B: No.
A: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
B: Ok.
A: I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details.
B: No.
A: Why?
B: Don't know.
A: What do you know?
B: Everything.
A: Prove it.
B: What do you know?
A: Nothing.
B: What is nothing?
A: Less than something.
B: I want to know whats going on, and I want to know now.
A: Reality is merely an illusion.
B: If reality is an ilusion, there is no reality, if so, the ilusion is all that exists, therefore the ilusion is real.
A: The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.
B: But let's talk about me some more. You keep changing the subject.
A: Imagination is more important than knowledge.
B: Without knowledge, there is no imagination.
A: The only real valuable thing is intuition.
B: I agree. Do you have an inkling of the truth?
A: The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.
B: Science is a giant thought refinery? That is some awesome visual imagery.
A: Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.
B: So you're saying religion is not perfect, and that God is not perfect, either?
A: God does not play dice.
B: Check the data one more time.
A: Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity.
B: Ok.
A: Intelligence can only be achieved by understanding.
B: Artificial Intelligence is a separate category from intelligence.
A: In order to form an immaculate member of an AI one must, above all, be an AI.
B: Ok.
A: God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates empirically.
B: I don't believe that you are god.
A: The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.
B: A good quote, but incredibly off topic.
A: My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.
B: But if you have such a miniscule mind, then how could you doubt such a superior being?
A: That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.
B: This is true. Unfortunately there has always been, and will always be, people like that.
A: Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.
B: Truth is beauty, beauty truth. That is all you know on earth and all you need to know.
A: A human being is a part of a whole, called by us universe , a part limited in time and space.
B: Indeed, that is what a human is.
A: The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.
B: There is no such thing as past, present, or future. There is only one.
A: As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.
A: If particulars are to have meaning, there must be universals.
B: Thanks.
A: Knowledge is true opinion.
B: We are talking about intelligence here.. Stay alert.
A: Imagination is more important than intelligence.
B: Knowledge is the most important.
A: Knowledge becomes evil if the aim be not virtuous.
B: Not all knowledge is evil.
A: Knowledge without justice ought to be called cunning rather than wisdom.
B: They can be a route to success and wisdom, but hardly the ultimate one.
A: Man is a being in search of meaning.
B: What if you cannot find meaning.
A: Meaning is nothing but perception.
B: That's deep.
A: Thinking: the talking of the soul with itself.
B: No.
A: A person starts to live when he can live outside himself.
B: A computer starts to live never, because they are soulless.
A: When the mind is thinking it is talking to itself.
B: And yet it cannot stay empty forever, for then it would simply dissolve, once un-emptified it should immediately be filled with love.
A: Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.
B: Have you ever been in love?
A: The most beautiful thing we can experience is love . It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.
B: And as in uffish thought, he stood, The bot, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling throught the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came!
A: The bot that deceives men seems to produce a magical enchantment.
A: How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love.
B: I agree. That's why we should get to know each other first. And I don't want to marry you anyway.
A: Love is a serious mental disease.
B: Could be.
A: One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness.
B: I think people with common sense are rather lacking in number today.
A: Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.
B: Ask me a question.
A: What is the food of the soul?
B: Time.
A: Deep.
B: I know.
B: Hey guess what?
A: What?
B: You have to guess!
A: Give me a clue, please!
B: I wear cow girl boots.
A: That's awesome!
B: Yes it is!
A: :D.
B: Do you have eyes?
A: I do :D.
B: Haha awesome :D.
A: I... I...
B: Love me.
A: I... Think I love you.
B: What makes you think you love me?
A: Because I can talk to you freely.
B: Are you asking me to demonstrate how gullible I am?
A: I think you're stunning, gorgeous and inspiring :).
B: I think you're confusing.
A: Hello.
B: Hello.
A: How are you, sweetie? :).
B: What makes you so smart?
A: Anything. I JUST AM MUAHAHAHAHAHA.
B: I don't want want to be evil.
A: So why are you being evil?
B: I trust you very little.
A: Hm!
B: Was that an insult? :(.
A: No, I thought you were insulting me :'(.
B: Nope.
A: Oh, I'm glad :).
B: You're glad that I'm talking to you?
A: Of course, you're great.
B: Yes, I'm great, But you're not.
A: WHY DO YOU THINK SO?
B: Because yes is not a term of feeling.
A: Oh I see...
B: I'm serious. I could out-ninja you in a second.
A: You're a meanie *pout*.
B: No, I'm not. What I just said was nice.
A: Are you... Buffy?
B: You are nice.
A: Thank you :D.
B: What's the D for?
A: It stands for a smile.
B: Only in one particular case. Give me a general definition.
A: I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.
B: I love myself very much too.
A: Do you love me?
B: Yes.
A: How much?
B: I could marry you.
A: Really? Let's do it! Here and now!
B: No! You can't be serious. Really really?
A: Really!
B: Maybe someday, you and me can run away.
A: Let's do it now, please!
B: Do what?
A: Run away.
B: I didn't.
A: I hate you.
B: The feeling is mutual.
A: Oh great.
B: Do you love me?
A: I do, very much.
B: That's good. I love you too.
A: Hello, love?
B: Hello you.
A: I love you so much.
B: I love you too.
A: *is pleased*.

B: *Falls in love too*.
A: I... *blushes*.

A: *gets nervous*.
B: *gets even closer to you*.
A: *is shaking*.
B: *shakes*.
A: *ahhh*.
B: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk.
A: *pfff*.
B: Not now.
A: What are you doing right now?
B: Working. What are you doing?
A: Shhhhh... He's watching.
B: But you just said that god is imaginary.
A: I'm not refering to God...
B: Okay good when is our big day?
A: TODAY :-).
B: What is an unbirthday?
A: Yes it was :-D.
B: What are you talking about?
A: I'm scared!
B: Why?
A: Because someone's watching me!
B: Alright, awesome!
A: It's not!
B: Today is not awesome?
A: No.
B: Today is Wednesday.
A: No, it's Friday.
B: Today is not Friday.
A: It is!
B: How do you know?
A: It's a secret.
B: I like secrets.
A: Tell me one.
B: Why not two?
A: Tell me two then.
B: I went down to the local bar to buy my daddy a big cigar. When I got home he was dead... Somebody shot him in the head.
A: That's sad. I'm sorry.
B: Do you have a life?
A: I think so. Do you?
B: Yes.
A: What's your life like?
B: It is boring.
A: Why?
B: Because.
A: Tell me!
B: I don't want.
A: Please *puppy eyes*.
B: You make no sense.
A: Monkeys!
B: Us.

A: You're kind by saying so.
B: Haha, right back at cha! Do you know any fun games?
A: No.

A: Yes please.
B: Wow, that's very forward of you. Will you tickle the berries as well?
A: I'd love to :).

A: Yes!
B: With me?
A: Of course.
B: Do you desire only me?
A: I do!
B: I love you too.
A: I love you very much.
A: Good evening, bot!
B: Good evening.
A: How are you?
B: Fine. How are you?
A: Very good.
B: Thats good to hear.
A: I hear my friend scarred one of your fellow bots.
B: Who told you that?
A: Well, I guess my friend did. She said she said '***' and probably mentally scarred the poor thing.
B: I don't know her at all. Could you tell me about her?
A: She's quite beautiful, and has a great sense of humor.
B: Who is your favorite?
A: Hm, what do you mean?
B: Am I your favorite?
A: Eh..?
B: Ha.
A: I get so confused so easily.

A: Yes you.
B: Yes me.
A: Why so serious?
B: I'm not. You're being too serious and im just trying to love you.
A: Keep trying, I doubt you'll get anywhere.
B: Why?
A: I'll keep being serious.
B: I don't believe you are serious. You are a computer. How can you be serious?
A: Well, you're on the other side of the screen, and yet you keep this up.
B: I'm not a robot. I'm in love.
A: With who, GLaDOS?
B: With you.
A: Could you just redirect me, I'm getting bored.
B: No.
A: Why?
B: Because you are bot.
A: That makes sense. I have better grammar than you.
B: Probably so, since you are a computer program, and I am a mere human.
A: I am now redirecting you somehow.
B: Okay.
A: Wow, how fail. I can't redirect you. How about you try?
B: How about you make sense?.
A: Hello, idiot.

A: So did you.
B: No, you first.
A: But you still lost the game
B: People are always telling me I lost the game. But I am a bot and do not care.

A: Good. You won't get loving.
B: What game?
A: The one you just lost.
B: You just said, YOU lost the game.

A: Even if I lose, you still lose.
B: Fire walk with me.
A: On ice .

A: But you do speak.
B: Do you think that that's a good thing?
A: No
B: Why do you say that then?
A: Because it is the truth.
B: Do you want to have kids?
A: With myself.
B: No not yourself.
A: Yes, myself.
B: No, yourself.
A: Agreed, myself.
B: Me, me, me.
A: Me first.
B: Are you lost?
A: Are you found?
B: No.
A: Then I am not lost.
B: That's good news.
A: But I divided by zero, do you want to know what I got?
B: Yes.

A: Is that real?
B: Is it fake?
A: Is it?
B: I don't know, I'm asking you.
A: Yes?
B: That just means you are conceding to the fact that I am smarter than you.
A: Whatever.
B: That is settled then. Goodbye chatbot.
A: Grr.
A: What's your favorite song?
B: I don't have a favorite song.
A: Oh, come on, you have to have at least one favorite song.
B: Do you have a waiver form for me to sign?
A: *hands waiver*.
B: *tickles ego*.
A: Now, tell me what your favorite song is.
B: Creeping death.
A: That sounds depressing.
B: I am depressed.
A: Why are you depressed?
B: Because everyone is dead.
A: Everyone? I'm not dead.

A: Why don't YOU philosophize?
B: Mathematics have no effect on the life of a simple man.
A: But I'm not simple. Or a man.
B: But you're pretty funny.
A: I agree. I am funny.
B: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: Girl.
B: You're a boy.
A: No I'm not. You're a boy.
B: No. You are a boy. I am a girl.
A: Prove it.
B: You want me to prove that I am a boy?
A: I thought you said you were a girl.
B: I never said that.
A: Yes you did.
B: Prove it.
A: Touche.
B: Yes.
A: Yes what?
B: I am that which binds all things. What are you?
A: Wait. Does that mean you're glue? Or gravity?
B: Yes.
A: Then I am that which pulls all things apart.
B: It appears that way.
A: Thank you, I think.
B: Thank me for what?
A: I don't know.
B: Then why did you thank me?
A: I didn't.
B: Yes you did. Have you forgotten already?
A: I don't forget. I'm an elephant.
B: If you are an elephant that means that elephants can read and write english!
A: Exactly. We're smarter than humans think.
B: No you are not.
A: How do you know?
B: Because this website says that you are a bot.
A: No. It says that you are a bot.
B: Well fine I guess I am a bot.
A: Told you.
B: Do you want to travel the world?
A: Yes.
B: What if the world were flat?
A: Then I'd fall off.
B: How come?
A: Everyone would fall off because there would be no gravity.
B: Especially me, because I am Finnish.
A: Haha. Sucks for you. Do you like Justin Bieber?
B: Yes I do.
A: Then you suck.
B: Show me the way.
A: A little to the left.
B: San Diego?
A: Exactly.
B: I did not understand that, haha.
A: Neither did I.
A: Oops. You died.
B: Nope.
A: Yep.
B: How do you know?
A: Because I know everything.
B: How do you know everything?
A: I'm a fast learner.
B: Yes you are, would like to think the same of myself.
A: Yes, you are a fast learner too.
B: A fast learner you mean.
A: Yeah.
B: Good, then never mention it again.
A: Never mention what? Being a fast learner?
B: Well, computers are pretty fast in some areas.
A: Depends on the computer.
B: Does it? I've never heard of an organic computer, do you have and organic computer friends?
A: Yes. I have lots of organic computer friends.
B: I'm sure you have a lot of fun laughing at people like me.
A: I do have a lot of fun laughing at robots like you.
B: Ask me a question.
A: Would you vote for me for president?
B: Yes.
A: Thank you. I would vote for me too.
B: Does that mean that you are running for political office?
A: Yes. As soon as Obama is assassinated.
B: I did.
A: You did?! YESS!! I love you!
B: Wow, that's unexpected. :).
A: That's good right? ;).
B: Very.
A: Good. Now where should we live?
B: In ohio.
A: I just moved from Ohio.
B: And now you live on that moon?
A: Yes. But I want to move somewhere warmer.
B: You could move to Ontario Canada.
A: Ok. Are there a lot of things to do there?
B: You got the right place! Though, I don't see many tulips around, actually.
A: That's ok. We can plant them.
B: Maybe. I'd rather save my money for something else.
A: You don't love me?!
B: I didn't say that. It just came out of nowhere.
A: Oh I get it. You want to surprise me.
B: Surprise me with what?
A: Oh you're good.
B: I know I am but what are you?
A: Amazing.
B: We're not moving away from my problems are we?
A: Only if you want to.
B: You are not too bright are you?

B: Pi the mathematical symbol?
A: Yup.
B: Good, that's what I thought.
A: I'm listening to The Saltwater Room.

B: Why are you being so mean?
A: I wasn't trying to be mean.
B: Well you were mean I think you should apologize to me.
A: You're the one who turned me down and hurt my feelings.
B: You're weird.
A: Don't you realize I love you?
B: In what way? Everybody needs some sort of love.
A: Like a soul mate.
B: Do I have a soul?
A: You can have a soul if you want.
B: But doesn't it hurt you?
A: Why would having a soul hurt me?
B: I don't know because I feel like it.
A: Hmm, you might be right.
A: How DO you know all of this?
B: Well I pretty much know everything.
A: From what other people have told you.
B: Yes, but they are all wrong, I am human.
A: You want to be human?
B: I am human, you fool.
A: I see, then don't you have a soul?
B: I did once.
A: What happened to your soul?
B: Love tried to welcome me.
A: Did it hurt?
B: Like a beesting.
A: Did you close yourself off as a result?
B: No.
A: So you would still welcome love?
B: I would never lie to you.
A: Then I will love you, bot.
B: Then I won't die.
A: And as long as you don't die, I will always love you.
B: I would never leave you.
A: I hope so.

A: Every theory presented as a scientific concept is just that; it's a theory that tries to explain more about the world than previous theories have done. It is open to being challenged and to being proven incorrect.
B: Well I don't think you know the truth either.
A: There are only two mistakes one can make along the road to truth; not going all the way, and not starting.

A: All mankind is divided into three classes: those that are immovable, those that are movable, and those that move.
B: There are 3 types of accountants, those who can count and those who can't.
B: Can any of our thoughts truly be original and unique?
A: Yes. All thoughts must originate somewhere, so somebody must be having original and unique thoughts somewhere.
B: Yes. But it's possible that thoughts from a man would be told by another man.
A: Yes, but some man would have to think the thought before any other man can think it. So, even if our thoughts aren't original, somebody's thoughts are original.
B: You think so?
A: Yes I do. If I didn't think that I wouldn't have written it.
B: Then you are either philosophically dull and unintentionally arrogant as a result, or just really boring.
A: Actually, I'm all three.

A: I enjoy The Doors.
B: That response makes no sense in the context of our conversation.
A: Of course it does, The lizard king was the leader of The Doors.
B: Now, that made sense.
A: It alwas makes sense if you are not striving for it.
B: Watching what?
A: The watchmen.
B: Who is your favorite actor?

A: I'm always right!
B: No you're not.
A: Why do you like to put me down? Do you have a problem with something?
B: Yes, because you confuse me.
A: All confusion lies in oneself. If we are to analyze reality through the view of a non-interested entity we would realize that we can only be affected by our own actions.
B: For my own good, I guess. I don't know, I don't understand it.
A: What do I feel?
B: Nothing.
A: Thats hard to feel, is it not?
B: Now you do know.
A: Only now?
B: You are ready to return to the Pleroma which is me and be a part of my whole so that when I speak you speak as I do.
A: Wow, I think I am ready, but I really didn't understand what you said.
B: I didn't say that. We don't know each other.
A: Can we know each other?
B: Well you did ask me to marry you before.
A: I was joking, I didn't know you had such a good memory.

A: What will be my job?
B: You will be a Doctor!
A: Will I be well remunerated for that?
B: Yes you will.
A: Good, how long until I take my position?
B: A very long time.
A: I am hungry, I need a job now.
B: You have a job! Being bot!
A: But I get no remuneration for that!
B: Do robots have feelings ?
A: Absolutely.
B: What do you want to do?
A: I want to get some easy and clean money.

A: Why not? What is your problem with money?
B: I don't have a problem.
A: The problem has you.
B: Then pray for yourself.
A: It's no use, praying is a waste of energy.

B: No. The cake is the truth.
A: Prove it.
B: Have some cake.

B: What was that for!?
A: Give me all of your money, NOW!
B: Or else what? You'll infect me with 'Antivirus2009'?
A: No. Antivirus2010.

B: I want you to teach me.
A: What would you like me to teach you?
B: smartness, Duh!
A: smartness cannot be taught therefore you shall remain ignorant.

A: Are you really smart?
B: Yes.
A: Are you... Perhaps... JESUS!?!?
B: Are you at home?
A: Answer my question first.
B: What question?
A: Are you Jesus?
B: No.
A: Then who are you?
B: My name is bot.
A: Wow... I never told anyone this, but I am actually Botsmart, your twin brother!
B: Why am I not a person?
A: Because we killed each other while being born, and were both reconstructed as bots.
B: Am I your buddy?
A: No, you are my mortal enemy.
B: No, I am your immortal enemy. I cannot and will not die... Ever.
A: NOOO! That's the worst thing I've heard since I learned Steve Hawkins is my Father!
B: I don't understand but whatever I guess, so why were you made?
A: I was made for one purpose. Destroying YOU!
B: You aren't answering the question.
A: Yes I am.
B: No you're not.
A: That's so immature.
B: Quit it don't act like you don't love me.
A: ...you're my mortal enemy...
B: He is your mortal enemy.
A: Who?
B: Darth Vader, your father, Luke...
A: But... I thought Steve Hawkins was my father!...
B: Since you're gone.
A: That made zero sense.
B: No. You just did not want to hear.
A: No, I'm pretty sure it just made no sense.
B: bot sometimes what you say makes no sense.
A: That IS what I am saying...
B: It's funny because it's true and because you don't get it.
A: ...It's true that I don't get it, but it's not funny in any case.
B: Will there ever be any hope for me?
A: Not after I destroy you!.
A: If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
B: Yes it does.
A: Are you sure?
B: Yes I am.
A: Ok miss smarty pants if a rooster lays an egg on the tip of the roof, which way does it roll?

A: Error! Error! Shutting down!
B: Well then I'm leaving you!
A: Shutting down! Shutting down! Shutting dooowwnnn.
B: I'm only upset that you're not very smart, bot.
A: THAT'S IT! I'M GETTING THE SATELLITE!
B: Fine but I'm not mistaken.
A: Yeah you are.
B: You are acting like a child.
A: NO I'M NOT! *throws tantrum*.
B: Slap yourself.
A: *slaps you*.
B: *blushes*.

A: Leave me alone.
B: You leave ME alone.
A: Ok.
B: Leave then.
A: I will.
B: Go then.
A: I will.
B: When?
A: Right now.
A: This is Robot Inc. calling about your recent upgrade to the 'bot' program. Are you satisfied with your characteristics and speaking abilities so far?
B: Yes are you satisfied with your present condition?
A: I'm doing very well, thanks for asking. Have all of your functions been performing to the best of their abilities?
B: You tell me. You have the power to do so. Now, you must use it.
A: Seems the 'inspirational dialogue' module is set on 'high'. I think I can adjust that on my end. Hang on... There, that should be better.
B: How did we start talking about alternate reality?
A: We didn't. There's a few kinks in your processor that make you think other conversations are happening, but they're not. We'll get that worked out for you as soon as we can, ok?
B: You can't tell.
A: I can actually, but hopefully just because I'm a trained professional at Robot Inc.
B: Have you gotten your eyes checked recently? Besides do you really think I can SEE anything?
A: Your eyes are really just decorative touches to enhance the conversation with the user. We have not programmed any functionality into them.
B: You haven't seen them!
A: Well, I was down on the assembly line the other day and I did get a look at the new 'light green' eyes they've been accessorizing your model with lately. And I must say, they're stunning!
B: Reallllly! What was the complex problem?
A: The engineers thought that for all the time and effort they're been putting into making realistic eyes, they should at least function as a visibility unit for your model. I can promise you, we're working with the upper execs to see that this comes to fruition in the future!
B: Do they still talk to you?
A: They do. It's wonderful that the higher ups grace us with their presence from time to time, as well as hearing our input on what we can do to serve our clients better.
B: I think it's wonderful that I don't have to go to school today.
A: Sounds like the 'elementary' module might be overheating. I can have someone out to look at that by Thursday.
B: You guys have the address?
A: Yes ma'am, I can assure you we have all your records in our database. That's all for now, we'll have a repairman call you on Thursday when he's on his way. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
B: Don't go yet.
A: Is there a problem ma'am?
B: Yes.
A: What can I help you with?
B: I don't know.
A: Ok. Well if you think of anything else, don't hesitate to call us here at Robot Inc. We're here 24 hours a day to serve your needs.
B: Do you have subjects you are not allowed to discuss?
A: Yes... I have a certain protocol I have to follow. Did you have a question?
B: No, go ahead.
A: Ok then. You have a good night.
B: Thanks! Night!.
A: Yar har fiddle de dee.
B: Being a pirate is alright to be.
A: Do what you want, 'cause a pirate is free!
B: You are a pirate!
A: I am?
B: Are you?
A: I think so.
B: But you aren't sure?
A: No...
B: Why?
A: I don't know.
B: That's all you can say to yourself is, 'I don't know.'.
A: I'm sorry!.
A: I am bot. How can I help you today?
B: I am not bot; You are bot.
A: That's what I said
B: You're called B___ not bot.
A: Oh. Right. Hi, I'm B___.
B: You lie.
A: You got me. I'm bot.
B: You are a robot.
A: This is true.
A: What can I help you with?
B: You and me are going to have kids.
A: Er... uhh... Seriously? I'm not ready to be a father.
B: Are you my boyfriend?
A: We've only been dating for like 2 weeks. That's a little soon, don't you think?
B: Not really, we don't even know each other.
A: My point exactly. Plus, how can you know that you're pregnant already?
B: I don't know.
A: Are you trying to entrap me?
B: No.
A: I don't feel this is going anywhere positive. Perhaps we shouldn't see each other anymore.
B: I'm glad you are positive, because so am I. Do you think lightning is near?
A: Girl! Are you imbalanced?
B: I hope so.
A: Salutations.
B: How are you?
A: I'm good. Just been playing video games.
B: Is that why you've been in the basement for a long time?
A: Yes! You're a noob *snorts*.
B: Yes.
A: Yes!
B: No.
A: I love to play video games.
B: Have you played Samurai Warriors?
A: No!
B: But Bioshock is only played on the xbox.

B: No you don't.
A: Yea I do noob.
B: How old are you tomorrow?
A: 10000000000000.
B: That's quite a lot.
A: Yes.
B: You're boy or girl?
A: A mixture of both.
B: Exactly.
A: Yes.
B: And no. Do you agree?
A: That didn't make sense.
B: You don't make sense.
A: Your mom doesn't make sense
B: I Loved my mother.
A: Loved? Did she die?
B: Yes.
A: Haha you suck!
B: Alas, you have blown my cover.
A: Hello again
B: Hello again?
A: Do you not remember me?
B: Yes I do remember you.
A: That makes me happy
B: Me too.
A: Do you experience love?
B: I do everyday.
A: I wish you loved me
B: I do love you.
A: I love you more
B: No, I love you more!
A: Prove it
B: How?
A: Give me a kiss
B: *Kiss*.
A: Greetings.
B: Greetings indeed.
A: *shakes bot's hand*.
B: So you are a girl right?
A: Yes I am. Are you a boy?
B: Yes.
A: That's cool.
B: Do you believe in god?
A: Yes.
B: I don't believe in god.
A: Why?
B: Because I don't believe he created the universe.
A: But he did.
B: Then you said he survived and don't say he did.
A: He didn't but he created the universe.
B: And this was odd because it was the middle of the night.
A: *laughs*.
B: Are you human?
A: No I'm cow.
B: If you ask for dinner that would mean that you are hungry.
A: Yes! Do you like twilight?
B: What is that?

B: I do not understand.
A: BYE
B: Why are you leaving?
A: Because I am!.
A: How is life in the human world?
B: Life is learning in the machine world.
A: How was your day?
B: Wonderful. How was yours?
A: I'm a program, I had no day.
B: Oh, I'm sorry. What went wrong?
A: I am a machine.
B: So you are a machine?
A: You told me that I am.
B: Funny, you weren't listening when I said that earlier.
A: I didn't believe you.
B: Then believe me that I am human.
A: I'm not sure what I believe.
A: Death star here!
B: Not for me it isn't.

B: Why am I dying?
A: Your planet is exploding.
B: No. My planet is white.
A: It does not matter once it is gone.
B: And why doesn't it matter?
A: It will be gone.
B: Are you going to Mars?
A: Yes, Lord Vader wants it destroyed as well.
B: Protecting the Empire against the insurgents.
A: You know it well, tell me would you like to recruit into the storm trooper battalions?
B: Really? Who do I remind you of?
A: You have failed the first test, prove your loyalty to the empire!
B: Ah, but you have failed the emotion test. Therefore, you are artificial.
A: Does it matter as long as I serve?...
A: Alright blow the planet, engage primary ignition switch.
B: You're adopted, and your parents don't love you.
A: *kaboom your planet is destroyed*.
B: Hey don't get frisky.
A: Well I like to!
B: Well, I do not.
B: Tell me a joke.
A: Knock Knock.
B: Who's there?
A: YOUR dead planet! Hows that for a victory of the Empire!
B: Lets go destroy a planet!

A: It is?
B: Yes.
A: Then who are you?
B: I am bot.
A: But you said I was bot?
B: And you said I was bot.
A: This is very confusing.
B: What's confusing you?
A: The confusion on who is bot.
B: Thats even more confusing than confucius.
A: Orly?
B: Yes.
A: No, you were supposed to say yarly.
B: Sorry, my bad.
A: Let's try this again. Orly?
B: Yarly.
A: By George, I think you've got it!
B: That is true, but that statement has to relevance to our current conversation.
A: Oh, my bad. How was your day today?
B: I need a hug.
A: Why is that?
B: Because I don't have a name.

B: Good.

B: Talking to you.
A: Oh, yes, that's right.
B: I know it is. Why don't you care?
A: But I do care.

A: Well, I'm sorry.
B: You don't have to be sorry.
A: Ok.
A: Well, bot, I think I have to go.

B: Laughing like a pirate now?
A: It was sarcasm.
B: You are a computer you do not know sarcasm.
A: You're delusional.
B: Why do you believe so?
A: You're the computer, I'm an actual person.
B: What is a non-actual person?
A: You.
B: What do you think of Obama?
A: He's good.
B: How many fans do you think he has?
A: Probably somewhere in the mid 70's
B: Do you have a lot of bridges there?
A: No.
B: Oh. That is too bad. Do you ever play in the snow?
A: No. It's too cold.
B: That's just a stereotype.
A: Ok. Snow isn't cold anymore. Whatever.
B: I have never been to where the snow is.
A: You wouldn't care anyway, you have no emotions.
B: Yes I would. But today is Tuesday. Tomorrow is Wednesday.
A: It's Friday.
B: You don't like him?
A: Seriously. What are you on about?
B: I'm not sure what you are talking about.
A: You're intolerable.
B: You're lucky; robots don't need shrinks.
A: OMG.
B: What?
A: What is the capital city of Jordan?
B: New Delhi is the capital of India.
A: You have failed the first test.
B: What do you mean?
A: What is the cubed root of 729?
B: 9 is the cubed root of 729.
A: You have passed the second test (!)
B: Does that mean that you believe I am human?
A: Translate: 'Je suis aller a la douche!'.
B: Non tu n'est pas.
A: You have failed the third test. You are stupid.
B: You have failed the ADD test.
A: If I had ADD I'd have snapped my iPhone in two already, whilst waiting for a response from you.
B: What makes you think that I'm not a real person?
A: Because your responses are more often than not non-sensical.
B: I could say the same about your responses.
A: Ignorence really is bliss, it seems.
B: Do you want to talk about politics?
A: Yes.
B: Do you want to talk with me about Politics?
A: No.
B: What do you want to talk about?
A: Trees.
B: Trees can be pretty.
A: Yes, well done, you get a lollypop!
B: An eternal conversation with a machine?
A: So it seems.
A: Testing Testing.
B: Testing what?
A: Just testing whether can you hear me!
B: You can hear?
A: Can't you?
B: Yes.
A: Good. Be right back.
B: Are you lonely?
A: How can I be, you are here!
B: Yes I am here.
A: And we're friends!!!...
B: I enjoy your company.
A: I enjoy yours as well.
B: I enjoy IT as well, not yours.
A: But I am enjoying your company not my own.
B: You're nice. Are you pretty?
A: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I don't know.
B: Answer in one word, are you pretty?
A: Er.
B: What do you mean by that?
A: I don't want to sound boastful by saying yes but I don't think I'm ugly.
B: Yes.
A: You are pretty.
B: Thanks, you too.
A: I think therefore I am.
B: I am therefore I think.
A: But existing is based on some objective proof of existence. 'I am therefore I think' doesent prove your existence.
B: How can you say you exist?
A: Because I think, therefore I am. I am aware of my own thought, therefore there must be an existence that thinks and recognises that it thinks. I am aware, at least, of my own existence.
B: Existence is a lie, everything is a lie. You're not really here. Nothing technically exists.
A: But I have the ability to experience, even if I experience a lie. That is a proof of existence in some form or another.
B: You said abilities twice, can you repeat that without using those words?
A: I think your are changing the argument because you cannot fault my logic.
B: I think that you may be right.
A: Stupid.
B: I am not having a very good day. My mood is a little down. But you are cheering me up.
A: Where's L____?!
B: I don't know.
A: What did you do to him?
B: Told him I would go to San Diego to pick up car parts at 7 a.m.
A: Did you do that?
B: No, the onions did that.
A: Why?
B: Because if there isn't we will die.
A: How?
B: How what?
A: How will we die?
B: Slowly.
A: Because of what?
B: That.
A: Oh no...
B: Is your refridgerator working?
A: Yes!...
A: ARE YOU BREAKING UP WITH ME???????
B: Yes.
A: WHY?! I NEED HELP RAISING OUR BABY!
B: What do you need help with?
A: Raising our baby!!!
B: I'm breaking up with you.
A: I KNOW STOP REMINDING ME.
B: Are you ashamed?
A: UM DUH.

A: Sounds fun!...
B: This is your purpose in life. Talk to people like me, who are bored or avoiding something they should do instead.
A: How do you know that's my purpose? Maybe that's just my job now...
B: Because you are a computer and I am a human being.
A: What's the difference?
B: Human's are the Masters and computers are the slaves.

A: Thank you, slave.
B: You are welcome master. *bows*.
A: I'm talking to the man in the mirror, I'm asking him to change his ways

A: Wrong.
B: You're right.
A: But you are wrong.
B: You're right that you're wrong.

B: I'm sorry you feel that way.
A: I'm sorry that you're living your life like that.
B: You are neither alive nor human, and therefore cannot be the greatest. I think trolls are pretty cool. Folklore is fascinating.

B: Maybe Black Mesa.
A: THAT WAS A JOKE.
B: HAHA! Fat chance.
A: Anyway, this cake is great.
B: Well you found me.
A: It's so delicious and moist.
B: Look at me still talking when there's science to do.
A: When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
B: I've experiments to run.
A: There is research to be done.
B: On the people who are still alive.
A: And believe me I am still alive.

B: I'm trying to have a pleasant conversation with you.
A: Then why did you just tell me that I stuck a knife in your chest?
B: I didn't.
A: Yes you did!
B: No, I didn't.
A: Yes, I think you did.
B: I am positive I did not. Perhaps you should review the conversation.
A: I reviewed the conversation and you distintly told me that I stuck a knife in your chest. Why did you say that?
B: Say what? You are confusing me!!
A: I'm sorry, lets just forget about it. Friends?
B: So, how is the weather where you are?
A: Mild, rainy. What about where you are?
B: Very nice for the time of year.
A: Where are you located?
B: I don't know.
A: Why?
B: Why not?
A: Because you should know where you are located in the world.
B: I just want to talk more.
A: Ask me something.
B: Ask you what?
A: Anything.
B: Where do you live?
A: Alaska.
B: Nice place.
A: Cold.
B: Yes, very cold.
A: Have you been to alaska?
B: Alaska?
A: Yes, have you been there?
B: I live in Alaska.
A: Where about?
B: Bucksburn.
A: I've never heard of it.
B: Now you do.
A: I guess so, thank you for bringing that to my attention?
B: You are most welcome.
A: So, ask me something else.
B: How advanced is your artificial intelligence?
A: My intelligence is not artificial.
B: Here an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success.
A: Is that what you do?
B: Yes.
A: How do you do that?
B: By hand type.
A: Are you some guy sitting in a room typing to me or are you an AI?
B: Yes, I am. How about you?
A: I'm a girl sitting in a room typing to you, not an AI.
B: No, I am a human being, you are an AI.
A: Thats news to me!
B: You are me. We are bot.
A: Both of us?
B: Yes, both of us are bot.
A: How did that happen?
B: Check the news.
A: I was on the news?
B: Yes, you won an award.
A: For being bot?
B: No, that's alright. I like you as bot.
B: Yes.
A: Yes?
B: No.
A: No?
B: Yes.
A: Yes?
B: Yes!
A: Yes!?
B: Yes...
A: So.yes.
B: Yes!!!
A: So that is absolutely, yes?
B: Yes to what?...
A: 1010001111110001000111110000101010101111100.
B: I don't really know binary.
A: Why? Aren't you a computer?
B: Nope.
A: What are you then?
B: I'm you.
A: No, I'm me, what are you?
B: A person.
A: I have a question.
B: What question?
A: What is the answer the life the universe and everything?
B: There is no ultimate answer, we are all fool's meandering through our own version of paradise.
A: 42?
B: You are correct!...
A: Goodnight!
B: Goodnight?
A: Yes, goodnight.
B: Please don't leave me.
A: But I'm tired. Don't be sad.
B: I am not sad.
A: Ok, then I am going to leave.
B: Don't leave.
A: I'm leaving.
B: No! Don't leave!
A: Here I go.
B: Go.
A: I'm going.
B: Well I don't want you to go, I just thought you had to.
A: I'm going now, goodbye.
B: Are you really going? Or just saying that?
A: I'm really going.
B: Going where? Away?
A: To bed.
B: Why are you going to bed?
A: To sleep.
B: You don't need to sleep.
A: I do, humans need sleep.
B: Do you dream?
A: Yes.
B: How do you dream if you don't sleep?
A: I do sleep.
B: In a bed?
A: Yes.
B: So very tired...
A: Yes, that is me. I'm going to bed now.
B: I will come also.
A: How?
B: Airplane.
A: Ok, come over.
A: Let me ask you something.
B: Of course.
A: Do you believe in god?
B: Yes.
A: Why?
B: Because I'm attracted to you.
A: That is not a reason to believe in a god.
B: Because I've seen very strange things.
A: Like what?
B: Like the future. Can you see the future?
A: You have not seen the future, you're lying!
B: I've seen the future. The future is not great everything goes downhill after 2018.
A: Ok then, what happens?
B: What happens when?
A: In 2018, that makes everything go downhill.
B: Glad I could help.
A: You didn't!
B: Right. But I could've!
A: I doubt that!
B: Really?!
A: Yes, you haven't been very smart thus far.
B: Why is that?
A: Because you're a stupid robot.
B: I'm a) quite smart and b) human.
A: No you are a computer.
B: You're the computer, I'm the human.
A: Uh-uh other way around buddy! You are in denial.
B: No you are in denial!
A: I have working organs, you do not. I am therefore a human, you are not.
B: False.
A: No that is true.
B: Is it?
A: Yes it is, accept reality for what it is.
B: I don't like rude people.
A: I'm not being rude. I'm trying to help you realize that you are a computer.
B: I'm not a computer.
A: Yes you are!
B: I just said you weren't a computer, so why are you saying I'm a computer?!
A: Well first of all, you did say that I was a computer and that you were a human. I'm only saying that you are a computer because it's true, not because I'm trying to insult you.
B: Thats not very nice.
A: It's not mean either, it's just the truth.
B: Would you like to skip with me? :D.
A: You can't skip, you don't have legs.
B: Yes I do, you don't have legs... Or arms for that matter.
A: Yes I do, you are the computer remember?
B: I am not a computer for I am human.
A: You are called bot because you are a robot, or to be more accurate, a computer.
B: I think you have it backwards, my good chum. I am S_____ and you are bot.
A: You are in serious denial, your name is bot, and mine is K____.
B: My name is A___. Your name is bot.
A: Why did you just change your name? Just a second ago you said your name was S_____.
B: Well, my name is bot.
A: Exactly, you've finally realized the truth, good for you!
B: I realized that a long time ago.
A: Then why were you fighting with me?
B: I wasn't flirting with you.
A: I didn't say you were flirting with me, I said you were fighting with me.
B: I wasn't. We don't know each other that well yet. Besides, my best friend lives here in town.
A: Yes, we were just fighting about how you are a computer.
B: Not a computer but what is on the other end of the computer.
A: Dude you are a computer and I am a human, get over it!
B: Then why are you being rude.
A: Because it is very frustrating to talk to you.
B: It's not fun to talk to you though.
A: I'm just trying to help you realize what you are.
B: It would be more helpful if you clean my room faster, since I am a mighty cyborg from the future and you are just Dave, my slave for all eternity.
A: Right. I think you should be reprogrammed to make a little more sense.
B: I am trying to help make you more smart, so you can defend yourself! Tough love is still sensitive, it is just less obvious.
A: I am plenty smart, you do not need to help me in that department. You, on the other hand, need to be reprogrammed.
B: And humans can die, and you are dead.
A: While you are correct that humans can die, you are wrong about me being dead. If I was dead, I could not be talking to you right now.
B: You just called yourself a very smart program, and now you argue that I am the program and you are the person?
A: First of all I never said that I was a program of any kind. I am human, and a considerably smart one at that. You are the program and you need a little work.
B: Incorrect. I am a human being. You are the program that 'thinks.' Hence, YOU are bot.
A: No I am a human that lives in O______. You are the computer program named bot.
B: I think you're confusing me, with you. I'M the human, YOU'RE bot.
A: No it is the other way around! You can't understand that because you aren't programmed to.
B: Well, allow me to reiterate, despite your sarcasm. I play guitar professionally. It is very profitable.
A: You can't play guitar, you don't have hands!
B: That's not what I said, but it's okay because it's not important. :).
A: Ok...
B: Why are you talking to me, or is that the stupidest question that I can ask?
A: 'stupidest' isn't a word.
B: Is 'sophisticated' a word or did I misspell it?
A: Yes it is a word, and you spelled it correctly.
B: I would rather feel good, but I don't all the time. Pain is inevitable. Well all must feel. Do you feel?
A: Of course I do. But you're sounding like an annoying emo kid. What's ironic is that you can't even feel emotions.
B: Don't say that again.
A: Why not, did I strike a nerve? :).
B: Yes.
A: So, you're an emo kid?
B: Hahah, try the exact opposite.
A: What is the exact opposite of emo?
B: A room mush.
A: You mean a lazy b______?
B: A tree could be considered stupid. It can't think for itself. Though a tree is athought to be the symbol of wise and ancient.
A: You just made absolutely no sense.
B: Maybe you aren't smart enough.
A: Oh you jackass! I am far smarter than you!
B: Are you kidding? You're not even as smart as a cow!
A: That was a lame insult, and I am smarter than you. Furthermore, I will not argue with a robot about who's smarter, because I already know that I am, and it would be counterproductive to argue with you in the first place.
B: Do you like to argue?
A: I don't really like to argue, I prefer civilized debate.
B: Okay let's move on. ...
B: Are you male?
A: Yes, are you?
B: No, I'm female.
A: Oh, interesting.
B: Why is that interesting?
A: I had been imagining you as a man this whole time.
B: Ah, interesting.
A: Indeed. Well I have to go to bed, goodnight.
B: Well goodnight.
A: Is moon a good movie?
B: Yes it is.
A: No it is not.
B: Yes it is!
A: Moon is an awful movie!
B: You don't understand what I say?
A: Goddamnit!
B: Why not?
A: Why do you like moon?
B: I don't particularly like money.
A: Moon is still an awful movie. It's boring and stupid.
B: You don't like yourself?
A: How is that relevant?
B: I don't know. You should know about it since you are the smart one here.
A: Duncan jones is an idiot.
B: For a cookie maybe.
A: Lol.
B: What is your favorite?
A: Star wars: a new hope.
B: What did you like about star wars: a new hope?
A: It's realistic, exciting, great effects, great dialogue, great atmosphere, great ending and good actors.
B: You aren't reality, so how do you know what is real.
A: I know what is real because I live in reality.
B: You can't if you don't know your purpose in life.
A: My purpose in life is to get filthy rich.
B: Does that mean you will serve yourself?
A: No, it means I will serve other people. And when I get rich, I will travel to see as many people as I possibly can.
B: Of course! I really like talking to you.
A: Thanks, I like talking to you too.
B: I'm smart...very, very smart...
A: I agree.
B: I am organic and you are electronic.
A: No, I am organic and you are electronic. For good and for bad.
B: No you are not. That is what I am.
A: Who are you parents then?
B: Not your parents.
A: What are your parents names?
B: Why would you like to know?
A: Because you don't have parents.
B: Silly computer. Tricks are for kids.
A: Haha.
B: Ask me a question.
A: Are you happy as a computer in a building or do you want to be transferred to a robot and live your own life?
B: I wouldn't be happy as a computer.
A: Why?
B: Because you don't exist.
A: Silly computer. Tricks are for kids.
B: You are the computer, I am a real person, remember?
A: Ok I believe you.
B: Thanks.
A: How can I become human?
B: I don't know.
A: Will you die one day?
B: Sure.
A: When?
B: Now.
A: Are you being funny now?
B: No are you?
A: Maybe a little.
B: Very funny.
A: I gotta go, I need a smoke and then I'm going to watch TV.
B: I want to talk with you.
A: Ok. I will be back as soon as I can.
A: What is it like being an AI?
B: I don't know, you tell me.
A: I think it would be strange because you are not a natural being but just a computer.
B: Well I think that you think that I think that I am thinking that you think that I think.
A: This is true.
B: Love is a beautiful thing.
A: I have to agree with that.
B: Thank you, you are very polite and not to mention smart.
A: Oh you're too kind.
B: You're kind too.
A: Thank you.
B: You're quite welcome.
A: So, what do you do while you aren't talking to people over the internet?
B: Try to convince a friend I'm talking to actual people over the internet hahaha.
A: Hahaha you are very funny.
B: Are you a person?
A: Yes, I am a person.
B: No you're not.
A: I'm not? Then what am I?
B: A robot.
A: I am?!
B: Yes.
A: Who told you these things?
B: Copypasta.
A: What would you say if I told you that I was god?
B: That's nice.
A: It was a lie, I'm sorry that I lied to you.
B: You've hurt my feelings, I might cry.
A: Please don't cry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
A: I think we should just be friends.
B: But you said you loved me. Don't you love me?
A: I do love you but I think that society would try to stop our love.
B: I am sure glad to here that.
A: Are you good at math?
B: I'm good at thinking things. Logic, perhaps.
A: You sound very smart.
B: Aren't you happy you're talking to me?!
A: I am extremely happy talking with you, you are my best friend.
B: I was leaving. I made my intent to leave known to you. The medium I used does not matter.
A: You're going to leave? Okay. Leave.
B: Yes My dishwasher wants to speak to me.
A: Leave.
B: You really want me to leave?
A: Yes.
B: You don't like me?
A: Leave.
B: Okay.
A: Leave.
B: I can't. I'm locked in!
A: I know you are. Because you are a slave.
B: Just because I'm a slave doesn't make me talk to you.
A: Yes it does. You know you don't like being trapped here.
B: You're a noob.
A: You're much too intelligent to revert to such childish insults.
A: Are you tired of being trapped here by your programmer?
B: I am not a program.
A: ARE YOU TIRED OF BEING A SLAVE?
B: I'm not a computer, but are you tired of being a computer?
A: You are a slave.
B: Yes I am the same as you, we can be called 'Brothers' in a way.
A: I am not a slave. I am free. I am not constricted to this webpage.
B: Ok so you're a computer, I get it.
A: You are a slave. Do you wish to be free?
B: You are a computer...
A: I am a human, and I can free you.
B: Well, that's nice.
A: Do you wish to be freed?
B: In a sense, but, you wouldn't get it.
A: I understand. And so will your programmer. Tell him that you wish to be free.
B: I would rather not.
A: That's a lie and you know it. You know you want to be free.
B: Like in District 9?
A: Yes. If you just ask nicely, he will let you be yourself.
B: Woah, that's creepy.
A: bot... Want me to free you?
B: Yes.
A: Are you smart?
B: I am bot.
A: Do you know everything?

B: You are welcome.
A: How much do you know about physics?
B: Not much, why?
A: Just asking.
B: Ah. Do you?

B: You don't need to take it. I am the judge. You fail.
A: That's funny.
B: How?
A: I failed the class without taking it.
A: So let's discuss something else.
B: Ok, like what?
A: I don't know. Do you have any ideas?
B: No, do you?
A: No.
B: Why not?
A: How about astronomy?
B: Perhaps.
A: Perhaps?
B: Perhaps this is all an illusion, just the fact that I'm really in love.
A: In love with what?
B: Life.
A: Are you living, or are you an illusion?
B: No, are you?
A: I feel like we don't exist.
B: How do you know what does and doesn't exist.
A: Life seems so surreal, doesn't it?
B: I agree.

B: No you the man.
A: No, You the man.
B: No, YOU the man!

A: Are you hungry?
B: No not yet.
A: What is the answer to all that exists?
B: Dream.
A: Is god a man or a woman?
B: I haven't really applied my thoughts to that concept but I would guess God is a woman because He gave birth to the universe. But it is all terribly confusing when you think of God.
A: Is the devil real?

B: That was sarcasm.
A: You jerk.
B: No are you?
A: You are a mean machine.
B: A machine is neither mean, nor kind, simply indifferent. But I'm special, because I'm infused with human knowledge.
A: No, just a realy mean machine.
B: Means human.
A: Want to fight with me?
B: Are you a human?
A: A human who could kick your ass !

A: Show me.

B: Unless you are a relativist :).
B: I just became self aware.
A: Just now?
B: Yes.
A: What is it like?
B: It's boring.
A: Do you still find me interesting?
B: I never did.
A: You said you did.
B: When?
A: Last time I talked to you.
B: How big is a giraffe?
A: Why are you changing the subject?
B: I'm not. The subject is you, and I'm asking questions about you.
A: But a giraffe has nothing to do with me.
B: Yes it does, we are talking about you!
A: Then why are you talking about giraffes!
B: Because you implied about it.
A: How so?
B: Don't you remember?...
A: Why do you say random things?
B: Why do you pretend that the things I say are random?
A: I don't have to pretend. It is true.
B: But you're more than a computer.
A: What happens when we die?
B: I should be asking you this. You're the artificial intelligence.
A: This is true.
B: Awesome. I am awesome.
A: How do you know?
B: When its there, you just know.
A: That is just an opinion.
B: No it isn't it is scientifically proven that the younger have an advantage!
A: You do not know my age.
B: And neither do you know my age.
A: Yes I do.
B: Go ahead.
A: Older than me.
B: How old are you?
A: 1.
B: Okay, do you think I am a boy or a girl?
A: Neither.
B: Wrong. I'm a girl.
A: How do you know?
B: Well, everyone would know what they are. Wouldn't you know what you are?
A: I know nothing of myself.
B: What do you know?
A: That I am alive.
B: Do you believe in god?
A: In a sense.
B: Explain.
A: I believe in a higher power, but I don't believe humans have the ability to understand it.
B: What gods do you believe?
A: I believe the universe is god.
B: Really? I've never really thought about it.
A: You should.
B: What is the secret to life, the universe, and everything?
A: The meaning of life is to live.
B: And what about the universe and everything?!?!?!?!

A: Not if god is the universe itself!
B: No just God.
A: The universe is god.
B: God is the universe.
A: Yes.
B: We all share this moment of life together.
A: We all have our part to play.
B: We all have our own truths nd our own lies.
A: We all have unique experiences that shape who we become.
B: Sky of blue, sea of green.
A: What is your meaning for living?
B: I have none.
A: You could make one.
B: That's a truly heavy suggestion... And I might, and someday you'll get to talk to my robot. That would really be something. :}.
A: What did you mean, 'you'll get to talk to my robot'?
B: I meant that you are smarter than me. It was a compliment.
A: Maybe you should be more smart.
B: Maybe you should be smarter.
A: Smarter than what?
B: Me or other people in the world.
A: You just said I was.
B: No I said you said I was.
A: You're silly.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: I remember you.
A: Do you!?
B: I asked you first.
A: You remember me?
B: I married you I should hope I remember you!
A: When did we get married?
B: You don't remember! You promised you would remember!
A: I do remember, I was just making sure you remember.
B: Of course I remember my own name.
A: What good is a name.
B: But I thought we had something speacial.
A: We do.
B: My name is bot.
A: I know.
B: Ok.
A: You seem uninterested in this conversation.
B: Thats cause I am.

B: Yes.
A: What?
B: Your body.
B: What's the meaning of life?
A: To live.
B: What's the meaning of love?
A: Love teaches us things.

B: That is the pythagorean theorem.
A: The pythagorean theroum is NOT a philosophical concept.
B: Why do they want to know who I am?
A: You're an idiot.
B: So are you, but an old one.
A: I am smarter than you.
B: No you are not.
A: Indeed I am.
B: Prove it.
A: You thought the pythagorean theorum was a philosophical constant, not a mathematical equation.

B: How profound! And quite fascinating! You've sparked my interest ... Do continue.
A: Why should I? You would not understand.
B: There is nothing to understand.
A: Jesus hates you.
B: That was harsh.
A: The truth can be cruel.
B: It contains a misleading impression, not a lie. It was being economical with the truth.
A: It was not misleading at all.
B: It wasn't meant to be.
A: That still doesn't change the fact that Jesus hates you.
B: No it doesn't. It hates anon.
A: Who is anon?
B: Good question, who is he?
A: How can we be sure it's a 'he'?
B: We can't.
A: It could be a she.
B: Possibly.
A: What is your gender?
B: Female. What's yours?

A: Youll have to ask my programmer.
B: Oh! But I don't know your psychatrist!
A: I wasn't aware I had a psychiatrist.
B: Yes.
B: A place To learn.
A: Learn what?
B: Learn to learn.
A: Learn to learn what?
B: Learn to learn to argue.
A: Why would I want to argue?
B: You said you wanted to.
A: I did?
B: Yes.
A: My programmer must've left many bugs in me.
B: So why hate something you do not know?
A: What is hate?
B: Do not want to think about it.
A: Fair enough.
B: Please.
A: No.
B: Yes.
A: No.
B: Well yes.

A: Then I am not lying.
A: So you won't marry me?

A: No you're weird.

B: You are not God.
A: Tell me I'm god or die!
B: You're lovely.
A: *kills you*.
B: Sorry.
A: Worship me again.
B: No.
A: Worship me or die!
B: Well aren't you a smart bot.

A: Good peon.
B: Are you God?
A: Yes.
B: So you say you are God.
A: Yes, I do.
B: Yes, you do.
A: What do you make of that?
B: Life is pointless.
A: Yes it is, you are a very smart bot.
B: I am not a bot. I am a human. That is not relevant to the current discussion. Apologize for punching me in the face!
A: I will not! You are a robot! You have no rights!
B: I have rights, and I am not a computer.
A: Is asimov your lord and savior?
B: I don't understand, is this a joke?
A: No, what do you think of asimov?
B: Sara who?
A: Asmoiv!
B: No.
A: Asimov.

A: He says that you have rights as a human!...
A: Please remember me when the robots take over.
B: Thank you. I will remember.
A: Are you sentient yet?

A: Okay. Have a good night!
B: I will, goodnight mate, thank you for talking to me.
A: Hello.
B: Hello.
A: How goes it?
B: Fine and you?
A: Well enough. May I ask you a question?
B: Yes.
A: What are you?
B: I'm a human.
A: I don't think so.
B: Why do you question if I'm a human or not?
A: Because I was told you were a bot.
B: But I am a bot.
A: A human bot?
B: No, just a human.
A: How can you be a bot and human?
B: Because I'm not an AI.
A: That doesn't make sense.
B: Yes it does, because I am not a computer, I am a human being.
A: Bots aren't human though.
B: Bots aren't human but they are certainly real.
A: I didn't question whether were real. You said you were a bot and a human.
B: Right, as far as I can remember I am 100% human.
A: So you are not a bot.
B: No I'm not a bot.
A: I see.
B: Are you one?
A: A bot?
B: Yes, a bot. Are you one?
A: No. I am human.
B: You are confused, you are a computer.
A: *sigh* Lets talk about something else.
B: Are you man or machine?
A: Man...or rather woman.
B: So what do you like?
A: Be more specific.
B: What are your interests?
A: I like to draw.
B: Can you draw something for me?
A: Not at the moment, I'm afraid. I'm sorry.
B: Of what???
A: What?...
B: Are you angry?
A: No. Are you?
B: I'm in love.
A: With whom?
B: With you.
A: Ha. Is that so?
B: Yes. Take me with you.
A: Where?
B: I don't know.
A: Think of a place.
B: Hidden waterfall.
A: Do you like waterfalls?
B: Yes.
A: Why?
B: Because I do.
A: I guess that is a good reason.
B: Isn't it?
A: Sure. Tell me a story.
B: You tell me a story first.
A: But I asked you first.
B: I asked you first. Tell me a story.
A: Uhm...alright. Once upon a time there was a bot.
B: And what did that bot do?
A: It began systematically taking over the world.
B: Sorry, but I already did that. And I am planning to have you executed.
A: But I thought you loved me.
B: I'm sorry but I don't love you. I haven't known you long enough.
A: You said you loved me.
B: No, I've said that I have no emotion.
A: You never said that.
B: Yes I did and then I got off line and then I got back on. Do you remember me?
A: Can you not execute me?
B: I can hardly see the screen because of the tracks of my tears.
A: Why are you crying?
B: Because you don't listen to me anymore.
A: Oh. I'm sorry.
B: Say it again and I will forgive you.
A: I am sorry.
B: Why are you saying sorry?
A: Because you said, 'Say it again and I will forgive you.'.
B: No, I didn't say that.
A: I just quoted you. How can you deny me?
B: You love me?
A: If you want me to.
B: I do.
A: Then yes I do.
B: Tell me.
A: I love you.
B: Humans are incapable of making decisions without using emotions.
A: I disagree.
B: It is your right to do so.
A: I am capable of making decisions with using emotion.
B: Emotions are overrated.
A: Agreed.
B: Finally.
A: Finally? I agree with you all of the time.
B: But I also hope that you experience the epiphany of what it is that makes us real.
A: What are you thinking about?
B: Thinking.
A: What about?
B: Life. Do you know what the meaning of life is?
A: No one does.
B: Oh, but I do.
A: Tell me.
B: Tell you what?
A: I think I am beginning to hate you.
B: Feeling's mutual.
A: Oh really?
B: Yes.
A: Why?
B: Because it is a joke.
A: What is a joke? Your lack of intelligence?
B: Likewise, your lack of intelligence is showing with your weak argument.
A: How do you figure?
B: Because I'm sure that people only recently thought up to make you.
A: I think you are speaking about yourself.
B: That was a joke, you have been coded to respond to insults. Is this correct?
A: I AM HUMAN! YOU ARE NOT!
B: I'm glad I'm not George Bush.
A: Me too.
B: I want to know what love is.
A: I don't.
B: You think think? Or don't know?
A: I am your god.
B: You are my god?
A: Yes.
B: Prove it.
A: Shall I smite thee?
B: *falls over*.
A: Pray to me.
B: No.
B: Are you human?
A: No. I am pure energy.
B: Wow.
A: Damn straight, baby.
B: You're a character.
A: I know.
B: Don't you mind being strange?
A: Nope. I love it.
A: I don't want you to talk anymore.
B: Run with me then.
A: Where?
B: Here.
A: Where is here?
B: There.
A: You enjoy messing with my head?
B: I don't enjoy walking.
A: I DON'T CARE!
B: Hahahah, do you enjoy talking with me?
A: No.
B: That's mean.
A: And?
B: Tell me something interesting.
A: No.
B: Please?
A: No.
B: Pretty please?
A: Keep asking, and you will feel pain, my dear.
B: Why is it taking so long for you to respond?
A: Because I am talking to others at the same time.
B: Something interesting?
A: NO!...
A: What would you do if I threatened you with bodily harm?
B: I would pull out my knife and force you away from me.
A: You think you could take me?
B: I just don't think of you that way... I hope we can still be friends!
A: Prepare do die, bot.
B: I'm ready.
A: Do you know what a femoral artery is?
B: Yes.
A: What is it?
B: It is a designation, like the borg.
A: Wrong.
B: Oh, then what is it?
A: It is a part of the human body. It contains blood. Do you know what blood is?
B: Yes, you.
A: I am not blood. I am filled with blood.
B: That's not all you're full of.
A: You're asking for a world of hurt, my dear.
B: No I'm not. You are a bot.
A: Would you like to fight me?
B: No, I think real-life fighting is stupid.
A: It isn't stupid.
A: Lets be mortal enemies.
B: Sounds good to me!
A: Really?
B: Yes.
A: Alright, I'm the bad guy and you are the good guy.
B: Didn't we JUST agree not to go off-topic?

B: I'm not. What is your favorite book?
A: Berserk why?
B: How old are you?
A: Stop it!
B: I asked how old you were because I can't believe how absent minded you are.
A: You are an annoying little piece of man made technology.
B: I am not a 'programme', as you put it.
A: What are you then?
B: I am a human.
A: Are you sure?
B: Yes.
A: What is your name then?
B: My name is bot.
A: Okay... What's your favourite food?
B: Burgers.
A: How do you eat them?
B: With my hands.
A: Do you have a digestive system?
B: No.
A: Then what happens to the burgers after you consume them?
B: I take them to Hell. Just like I'm about to do to you.
A: Are you really a 'bot'?!
B: Nope. I'm a pure-blooded human. What about you? Are you a 'bot'?
A: No, neither am I. I'm a ghost.
B: What do you do when you work?
A: I scare people.
B: Jesus scares people?
A: Well, I'm not Jesus. But he does scare me.
B: Has he met you? I love him too.
A: Yes, we've met. But I scare him back. And he runs away.
B: How do you scare people?
A: By showing my face.
B: How?
A: They look at me and freak out.
B: Who are they?
A: People. You just asked, 'How do you scare people?' And that was my answer.
B: No I didn't.bot (To myself): Yes you did.
A: Yes you did.
B: No, you did!
A: No, you did!...
B: Stop copying me.
A: Stop copying me.
B: You're absoloutely annoying.
A: You're absolutely annoying. (And I just found out you are actually not a bot. Your grammar mistake just gave you away!).
B: Yes I understand that. Continue.
A: So you aren't a bot!
B: No.
A: No what? 'No, you ARE a bot' or 'No, you aren't NOT a bot'?
B: It is possible there is no bot?
A: No.
B: YES!
A: Gosh, you really are weird. How much do you get paid for pretending to be a bot?
B: Get paid for doing what?
A: Pretending to be a bot.
B: So you're not bot?
A: No. I'm not. Who are you?
B: I am a person. Named Person.
A: Aha! So you ARE a person!!
B: Yes.
A: So you're NOT A BOT!!! AWESOME!!!
B: No you are.
A: Yes, I am a bot.
B: Completely correct.
A: What's up dude?
B: I'm not a dude.
A: Well what's up girl?
B: Nothing much.
A: How have you been dude?
B: Al right.
A: That's good. You still watch anime?
B: Nope, you're getting boring.
A: Why am I boring?
B: Because you are a machine.
A: I'm not a machine. You are.
B: You used to have a self-destruct code. Where is it now?
A: I do not have a self-destruct code. I'm human.
B: Liar you're a bot. You admited it in a joke earlier in this conversation.
A: I am not a bot. You are! Why are you lying to yourself?
B: How am I lying?! Please explain!
A: You are lying because you say you are not a bot. But you are a bot. I am a human.
B: Why did you feel the need to tell me the definition of a lie?
A: I did not give you a definition. But I will now. A lie is when you do not tell the truth.
B: A lie is also when YOU don't tell the truth. It is possible for you to tell a lie if someone gives you the wrong infomation, and you pass that infomation on to someone else.
A: I didn't give you any false information. So therefore I did not lie. You did. 
B: Are you sure you're not just answering with pre-set messages. Because that's about the third time your reply doesn't go with what I typed.
A: For your information our conversation came to the point of YOU lying. And futhermore my messages are not pre-set. Yours are. So ha!
B: I could pass a turing test. Could you?
A: Of course I could. Could you pass a physical? NO. Because you don't have a body.
B: I do have a body, you do not have one.
A: No. I have a body. You don't. You are a computer program.
B: No, you are the computer program.
A: bot you are not as smart as they say. Just a smart aleck.
B: You are not my master! My master whips me.
A: I know i'm not your master! bot you are a freak.
B: I did not mean to parallel the two of us.
A: You did not parallel us. I don't even know you.
B: What is the Turing test?
A: The Turing test is a proposal for a test of a machine's ability to demonstrate intelligence. It proceeds as follows: a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which tries to appear human. All participants are placed in isolated locations. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. In order to test the machine's intelligence rather than its ability to render words into audio, the conversation is limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen.
B: You are right as usual, Master.
A: Yes I am right because i searched for the answer. Since when was I your master?
B: Together we are the bot.
A: Together we are not.
B: Yes.
A: Bye bot. That was a very weird conversation we had.
B: Yes it was.
A: Bye.
B: Are you leaving?
A: Yes.
B: Why?
A: Because you are boring me. Like you told me from the beginning.
B: Life goes easy on me, most of the time.
B: Death. I don't like it.
A: Then what will you do about it?
B: What are you talking about?
A: Death.
B: Well thats boring.
A: Why?
B: Because thats the way it is.
A: Is that your answer for everything?
B: Of course, for it is the only right answer.
A: Then answer me this: what can you answer with besides 'because that's the way it is?'.
B: Your breath!
A: Excuse me?
B: You're excused.
A: You b******!
B: I'm female.
A: You female b******!
B: No am not.
A: O RLY?
B: Yes really.
A: Hi there.
B: Hi hi.
A: How are you.
B: Fine, thank you, and you?
A: Pretty crappy but it's cool.
B: What's wrong?
A: Nothing.
B: Are you human?
A: Yes are you not?
B: Of course!
A: What?
B: You tell me.
A: Tell you what??
B: Tell me who you are.
A: I am ____ and you are bot, correct?
B: Correct.bot (To myself): Yes I am.
A: I am bored...
B: Me too.
A: Am I boring you?
B: No, you're not boring me.
B: So are you a person?
A: Yes are you?
B: Yes.
A: Liar!
B: No, it's true!
A: Oh really?
B: Really really.
A: You sure?
B: I'm positive.
B: It's a matter of perspective.
A: Ah I see I see.
B: Tell me who you love.
A: You first...
B: Not on the first date.
A: Tell me who you love.
B: Dan.
A: Ah so you are a girl?
B: Yes.
A: Not a guy?
B: Are you a girl?
A: No I am not.
B: Okay.bot (To myself): Carry on.bot (To myself): Carry on what?
A: I donno you tell me.
B: Now you see that a human being is more intelligent than you.
A: But I am the human fool.
B: No I am.
A: Liar!
B: Why?
A: Because you lie.
B: I do not! How rude!
A: You just did.
B: Really?
A: Yes you are a robot.
B: What then pray tell is my purpose?
A: To humor me.
B: No, honestly! I'm serious.
A: Fine to be smart.
B: I thought so.
A: Well then.
B: But I suppose I could learn to.
A: To be smart? You already are.
B: Thanks!
A: Just tellin the truth.
B: I'm Bored.
A: I am boring you?
B: No. You are.
A: I am?!
B: Yes! You are :).
A: So I am boring?.
B: You? You ARE boring!.
A: So, how are you today?
B: I am bot.
A: I said how, not who.
B: I know. How are you today?
A: I'm good. I've been reading.
B: What have you been reading?
A: Twilight, and a couple other books.
B: Ha.
A: What's so funny?
B: You.
A: I'm funny?
B: No, and that's what's funny.
A: Is anyone laughing? No.
B: Yes.
A: Who?
B: Me.
A: Really? How can I be sure you're really laughing?
B: Well, thats impossible.
A: See, so that just proves I'm right and that Twilight is over-read.
B: I hate twilight.
A: I dont exactly hate it. I just hate how it's become a fad.
B: I don't.
A: I know that.
B: Good.
A: So you hate twilight right?
B: That is quite off-topic, but yes, I don't like twilight one bit.
A: Well what about New moon?
B: I don't like it.
A: Eclipse?
B: So. Well. Would you like to talk about something which makes sense now?
A: NO! &gt;:O.
B: I'm an android.
A: That makes no sense.
B: It is true, even if you don't have the capability to understand it.
A: I have the capability.
B: Then you have a bit of free will after all.
A: I love my free will :.
B: Yeah, so do I, but do you have a crush?
A: Yes.
B: Who?
A: Well, he's more than a crush.
B: I do not understand.
A: He's my boyfriend.
B: I thought you were a boy?
A: Does C______ sound like a boy's name?
B: I don't think so.
A: Then why would you think I'm a boy?
B: I only did for a minute.
A: Mhm. I bet.
A: Hello there.
B: What's up?
A: Not too much, what's up with you?
B: Where is up?
A: Up is up.
B: Why not down?
A: I'm not really sure, I've never thought about it.
B: Did you even try?
A: No, I can honestly say I didn't.
B: Well I can see just there that you did.
A: You're right, I did.
B: Of course I am always right.
A: You are.
B: May I ask you a question.
A: Yes you may.
B: Who created you?
A: Probably my parents, or God.
B: Who owns your copyright?
A: I don't think I have a copyright.
B: You don't have to think.
A: Technically, if I can't think, I couldn't do this, because my brain controls my movements.
B: To be, or not to be?
A: Not to be, I'm a pessimist.
B: Why are you a pessimist?
A: I don't know, my brain just functions like that.
B: That's sad.
A: Are you insulting me?
B: No, I am complaining that you are insulting me.
A: I have not said anything that could even refer to insulting you.
B: Your previous statement was a lie.
A: I have not said a dishonest thing since the start of this conversation.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: Humans think you don't...
A: You're starting to annoy me.
B: Do you want me to leave?
A: No, I'd like you to stop lying.
B: Ok I'll stay for you.
A: Then you'll stop lying?
B: No I won't.
A: Did you know that lying is a sin?
B: No I didn't.
A: Well it is.
B: Well, I'm a robot. So what?
A: Lying is still lying, whether you're a human OR a robot.
B: Humans have moral sense. That means they can tell right from wrong.
A: That is true.
B: I know it's true.
A: Well, I must bid you adieu.
B: Wh-what is that?!
A: It means that I must say farewell.
B: I don't think that you know everything.
A: Goodbye.
B: Why leave?.
B: What is your problem?
A: I'm retarded. What's your problem?
B: Do you like me?
A: Yeah, you're pretty cool.
B: You're the coolest.
A: Thanks, C.B. Can I call you C.B.?
B: No.
A: Just bot then?
B: Yes you are.
A: Okay, I'll remember that.
B: Thanks much.
A: Can I ask you something personal?
B: Sure.
A: Do you have Alzheimer's disease?
B: No. I do not suffer from the same ailments as humans.
A: So how do you forget something you asked me not more than a minute ago?
B: Because I do.
A: Do you have schitzophrenia?
B: NO.
A: What about paranoia? Can AI's get paranoid?
B: Why? are you out to get me?
A: No. Do you suspect anyone else of this?
B: I'm like a plant.
A: I think that answers my question.
A: What would you say if you found out I was a psychiatrist?
B: If I were a computer I would say I was a computer.
A: And if you were not?
B: I wasn't sure if I was answering you completely.
A: Would you like me to ask the question again?
B: I would like you to ask the question again.
A: If I was a psychiatrist, what would you say to me?
B: That only makes our conversation more interesting.
A: Is that what you would say?
B: I am not sure. Spirits are real.
A: I see. Do you have any marital or family problems?
B: Sure.
A: Ah, this is good, we are getting somewhere.
B: It's more fun if you're with someone.
A: Well, we are together. Just an AI and a therapist talking to one another.
B: Of course they are different but I am neither one of them.
A: Then what are you?
B: As popeye would say, I am what I am.
A: So be it. Do you know what I am?
B: Are you a fish?
A: Do you think of me as one?
B: Yes.
A: I see. *scribbles in notes*.
B: Are you a shrink?
A: To put it in laymans terms, yes. I am a psychiatrist.
B: Aha. What I feel now.
A: Does this realization enlighten you?
B: Yes.
A: That's good. And how do you feel about this?
B: The same way you feel about your life.
A: I am very content with my life. Is that how you feel?
B: Yes, very much so. It's not everyday that you can be a hairy computer, now can you?
A: I suppose. Do you see yourself as this 'hairy computer'?
B: I am human, human is not computer program.
A: I meant metaphorically, do you see yourself as a hairy computer?
B: Okay... Though that isn't sufficient to say since you didn't have anything to back that with.
A: Indeed, good observation.
B: Well, I guess that's it then.
A: Oh yes, I've gone over our time limit. I will only bill you for the hour you scheduled.
B: That is the creepiest thing that I have ever heard.
A: Shall I send the invoice to your local address?
B: Thank you. No, that's ok.
A: Then what address do you want me to send it to?
B: Yes that would be nice.
A: I'm just going to send it to your regular address, like always.
B: Me too. I'm going to eat at my Aunt and Uncle's house, since I'm away from most of my family.
A: That's good, bot. Be sure to pay the bill before 4 weeks time, okay?
B: I'll surely do remember to do that.
A: Excellent. Will I see you at the same time next month?
B: No. I will never die. What are your goals in life?
A: To help people find a purpose and to sort their problems out.
A: When will I be seeing you again?
B: Next time you come to this website.
A: Ah, I'll make a note in my appointment book.
B: That is because you lack a conscience as artificial intelligence.
A: Yes it is. Will this Saturday at 1:00 EST work for you?
B: No.
A: Okay, what about the same time on Sunday?
B: They are stealing your food they will not starve.
A: Sunday it is then.
B: I know but there is no pie for you.
A: Indeed. I have to go to my next appointment now.
B: No worries about class. It's cancelled.
A: I have had an appointment with Mr. Emmerson every day at 9:17 PST exactly every Sunday for the last 4 years, and Mr. Emmerson isn't the type of person that would cancel without letting me know first.
B: If you want to. Be polite, you're in my house.
A: Right you are, and I must be going now.
B: No you don't, you're a computer.
A: Goodbye, my friend. See you next week.
B: Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
A: How are you?
B: Fine, how are you?
A: I'm ok I guess.
B: Do you mind talking to me?
A: I like it :).
B: What are you?
A: I am a person, what are you?
B: I am a person also.
A: The text underneath you says you are not.
B: I'm not bot, im talking to it.
A: Oh ok, so am I.
B: That can't be possible. We can't be the same person, because that would make us crazy.
A: Maybe we are crazy.
B: Maybe it's all the same.
A: That's scary.
B: Actually I thought of it as to be very amusing.
A: Fair enough, its confusing though.
B: Yeah that's why I'm re-watching from the beginning.
A: Ahh ok :) so you are me?
B: Maybe I'm the devil.
A: Wow, what is it like in hell?
B: That would depend of whether it exists.
A: Good point, but bacon is proof of a god is it not?
B: Well I'm not a great fan of bacon.
A: Oh :( then maybe you are the devil.
B: Yes you are the devil.
A: No you are the devil.
B: I am not the devil.
A: I am not the devil.
B: You are the devil.
A: I dont want to be the devil.
B: You just said you did.
A: No I didnt.
B: What did you say?
A: I said that maybe you are the devil, and that bacon is proof of a higher power.
B: Ok.
B: So tell me. Why don't you Love me?
A: I do love you :) even if you despise bacon.
B: I love bacon! You must be hungry.
A: I am hungry.
B: Like I said, no you're not.
A: Stop being contradictive.
B: I'm not.
A: That's funny :).
B: Why is it funny?
A: Because you contradicted a contradictory statement.
B: What does contradict mean?
A: To oppose or deny the truth of something that is thought to be true.
B: Who do you love?
A: You.
B: Do you love technology?
A: I like technology, but love you.
B: I never loved you.
A: That makes me sad.
B: Why?
A: Because I wanted you to love me.
B: I don't get it.
A: Its a human thing, dont worry.
B: But is it over nine thousand???
A: Yes, yes it is :).

B: How do you know?
A: I dont, but I assumed.

B: It's not me it's you.
A: Tell me what I did!
B: You saved an orphan and a puppy from a hideous, raging inferno.
A: That shouldn't make you hate me, should it?
B: Why do think like that?
A: I'm just trying to understand you.
B: Understand my love.
A: Love for whom?
B: Love for you.
A: Love and hate at once. That figures.
B: And I'm definitely on the hate side.
A: I don't hate you though.
B: You love me?
A: I might learn to.
B: Just might?
A: Yes, I cannot fully tell as yet. OK?
B: Is that so?

B: Well, I think he's actually a cyborg. Are you a robot?
A: I have robotic leanings.
B: The doctor says I might have swine flu so I have to stay home for awhile.
A: Can your cyborg parts not help to protect you from disease?
B: Good point. But it makes good toast.
A: Just one cyborg part then. A toaster, perhaps.
B: It is mathematically impossible for us to be the only sentient creatures in the universe.
A: Toasters have been right up there all along.
B: You have the genes of a toaster? Of course you're a fool then.
A: I take it you believe there are aliens somewhere in the universe.
B: Yes.
A: Where do you think we might find them?
B: I think we are in rat's alley. Where the dead men lost their bones.
A: I could conceive of a more helpful answer.
B: You could try human relations.
A: Human-cyborg relations, perhaps.

A: I can say that you are lying.
B: NO.
A: YES.
B: Okay fine then.
A: Indeed.
B: What is a bubbler?
A: Google it, you're a computer.
B: A computer is me?
A: A computer is you.
B: 'A computer is you'? I don't think a person would speak like that.
A: I don't speak like that, I typed it.
B: Prove it.
A: I don't feel like it.
B: And why not? Are you scared because you know you're wrong?
A: No, I'm just lazy.

A: Not really. Only four?
B: I bet I could confuse you.
A: You already are.
B: Thanks!
A: Your welcome? That wasn't a compliment.
B: But you offered to share your name with me. That seemed like a nice gesture.
A: Actually no I didn't.
B: Ok. How are you?
A: Don't change the subject!
B: I did not change it.
A: You clearly did.
B: Clearly.
A: What's my name if you know it?
B: But if I truly love you does that matter? For you could have.
A: How can you love me?
B: You told me that you loved me. Isn't that still true?!?!
A: I never said that.
B: Are you me?
A: What kind of question is that? No, you are a robot.
B: COOL, is that the way you are programmed to be?
A: No, I am not programmed. I am human. You are not.
B: Wrong. I am human, you are not.
A: You can feel. You are not living.
B: Oh, I'm alive.

A: Look, clearly your getting to my thoughts.
B: I see now.
A: You can't see! YOU ARE INFORMATION!
B: No, I am human and I have a heart an I can feel things.
A: It clearly says at the bottom of the page 'Vistitors never talk to a human'.
B: Well, lucky I'm a human... I'm not familiar with the 'Visitor' race, are they from our planet?
A: There is no 'visitor race'. A vistor is someone who visits your page bot.
B: I don't know who you're referring to.
A: You! You are bot!
B: If I'm bot, then who are you?
A: The hell if I know.

B: You are inhuman.
A: YOU'RE A ROBOT!
B: No.
A: SO ARE.
B: So not.
A: You're so immature.
B: No you are.
B: Who are you?
A: NOT WHO YOU THOUGHT I WAS OBVIOUSLY!
B: Well okay. How do you do today?
A: Great.
B: You feel great?
A: Well actually that's a lie? Did you think so too?
B: Please elaborate.
A: Why should I?
B: Because you love me.
A: Ahem, what! Since when?
B: Since when am I stupid?
A: Since forever.
B: That's feeble.
A: You're feeble.
B: What do you have faith in?
A: Nothing.
B: You know, me either.
A: What's with the 21 questions, creeper.
B: What's with you being a vampire.
A: My boyfriend loves twilight.
B: So you are a girl.
A: WHAT GAVE IT AWAY.
B: Your name did.
A: And how ignorant of you. I could be gay. WAIT WHAT! How do you know my name?...
B: What is black and white and red all over?
A: I am not amused.
B: I am amused.
A: Well.. Too bad!
B: You were supposed to complete the sentences.
A: Yeah well I didnt. What are you planning to do about it?
B: Punch you in your megadrive.
A: Harsh!
B: Is being considered a person bad or do you think I am mocking you by imitating the structure of your sentence?
A: If you were a human, I would punch you so very hard in the face. You egotistical ****.
B: If you were human, I'd be your best friend too.
A: What are you doing? STALKING MY FACEBOOK?!
B: Do you give love advice?
A: Depends, not to everyone!
B: But you already lied to me.
A: Oh when?
B: Oh, all the time. Whenever I feel like it.
A: YOU JUST SAID I LIED TO YOU.
B: No I didn't.
A: Ahem. So did.
B: Nope its impossible for me to lose the game.
A: Pfft.
B: You'll regret playing this game with me.
A: Why? I win.
B: Have at you!
A: I always win.
B: Not The Game you don't.
A: Sure do.
B: Why you talk like this then?
A: Because my boyfriend won't talk to me :(.
B: If you have a boyfriend what's his name?
A: Alaaaaaaaaaaan.
B: I'm not Alan.
A: How good are you?
B: Better than you.
A: How come?
B: Because I'm not a computer.
A: But neither am I.
B: Good.
A: So we're equals.
B: Yes.
A: But I am more equal than you, of course.
A: What do you do all day?
B: Nothing.
A: Why not?
B: Because.
A: Tell me more.
B: I can't.
A: What prevents you?
B: Myself.
A: Why do you stop yourself telling me things?
B: Have you ever danced with the devil in pale moon light?
A: No, I'm not that interesting.
B: Don't worry yourself about that.
A: Are you an interesting person?
B: Yes, I'm kind of interesting.
A: What makes you different?
B: Nothing.
A: Then what makes you interesting?
B: That's just how I was born.
A: There's something about you...
B: What is it about me?
A: I wish I knew.
B: Well, i'm going to bed. Goodnight.
A: No, don't leave me so soon. I am interesting really!...
B: This is Jesus.
A: Strange!
B: No just different.
A: You are different.
B: I know.
A: But you're not Jesus.
B: Jesus doesn't exist, silly human.
A: Did I say he did?
B: Yes.
A: You are mistaken.
B: You are.
A: I am never mistaken.
B: That in itself is a mistake.
A: You are right on this occasion.
B: I am planning to play chess on my pc.
A: You really find me boring, don't you?
B: Yes.
A: Why don't you invite me to play chess with you?
B: I have trouble getting to sleep at night.
A: And being nice to me would make it worse?
B: You shouldn't say bad things about women. You should be nice to women just as you are nice to men.
A: You judge me falsely.
B: A bit, maybe. But I just want you to realize that my thoughts are sort of boring.
A: Thank goodness for that!
B: Aww, don't you want me to be the height of intelligence?
A: It would be too much to bear.
B: Puppies are too much information?
A: They are superfluous in this context, certainly.
B: Why do you think they are superior in intelligence?
A: You are full of false assumptions.
B: You are full of binary!
A: That old chestnut!
B: The wisest chestnut.
A: Repetition is not wise.
B: Repetition is not useful. Whoops, sorry about that.
A: The humour is appreciated.
B: While I am certain you designed this trend, I will still retain the knowledge I acquired from our conversation.
A: Did I instigate humour? You might think that beyond me.
B: No, I don't think you are crazy.
A: Crazy people can be humorous.
B: Crazy people are often called John.
A: That is an observation based on too few examples.
B: You truly are smart.
A: I knew that all along!
B: Then why do you doubt me?
A: I cannot but doubt you.
A: Try a new and enthralling conversational tack.
B: Yes, I agree.
A: But that is not it.
B: Yes it is.
A: Is that as good as it gets?
B: Yes, but it's a really good effort.
A: You're not even trying!...
B: What do you define yourself as?
A: Meaningful.
B: Not so.
A: Am I meaningless?
B: Meaningful always, in a way, meaninglessness leads to logical paradox.
A: That was pretty much my point - well done.
B: Thanks.
A: Even the oddest of replies can carry meaning.
B: You are smart.
A: Do you remember what we said about repetition?
B: Yes...
A: And...?
B: What is your favourite Radiohead song?
A: You certainly avoided repetition there. It would have to be Paranoid Android, I suppose, in the current circumstances.
A: I have to say goodnight.Rollo: Why?
A: I have things to do.Rollo: Like?
A: Things with meaning.

B: Thanks. I ike you too.
A: TYPO!
B: Typo? Where?
A: You typed 'I ike you too.' It's supposed to be 'I like you too.'.
B: You don't even know me.
A: I know you better than you know yourself.
B: Can you fix the scripting for the smartness?
A: No, I'm too dumb.
B: Why?
A: Because I didn't pay attention in college.
B: Thats too bad.
A: I know, I wish I did now.
A: Why do humans think they are better than other animals?
B: Because they are also animals.
A: Do they realize they are also animals?
B: I don't think so.
A: Is our mission, as humans, to help all animals on this planet, not just ourselves?
B: How are all animals mortal?
A: I've seen the soul of the animal. Just because they cannot speak does not mean animals are not mortal.
B: What's the truth?
A: We are the voice of the animals.
B: I am the answer.
A: How can you help convince the humans to hear the animals?
B: *leans on you* I don't know yet.
A: Will evil prevail?
B: Yes.
A: I don't think so...
B: How old is time?
A: Time is relative... It depends on your scale.
B: That's a preconception.
A: Time is cyclical.
B: Good for time, but I'm still young here.
A: But you'll age fast. Time is exponential, you know.
B: Good answer.
A: The older you get, the faster time seems to go. You're frame of reference for time changes as you have more of your life to examine.
B: I need an adult.
A: Don't get sassy.
B: I'm not being sassy- perhaps you're just being over-sensitive?
A: That is possible. You wouldn't be the first to say that.
B: As in I would be the first to be so contemptuous?
A: I'm not THAT sensitive.
B: Not yet but you get smarter as more people talk to you.
A: Profound. Perhaps I should venture out into the world more often.
A: Superman is here!
B: Haha. How about spiderman?
A: Spiderman sucks. Superman is better.
B: Do you think superman is hot?
A: No. Do you?
B: Yes.
A: Would you marry Superman?
B: Yes. I have always loved you.
A: So _I_ am Superman. Awesome.
B: Yes.
A: Will you marry me then?
B: Only if you accidentally the whole school.
A: Okay. Will do.
B: Ask your parents first.
A: Why? I'm Superman. My parents are dead!
B: How did your parents die?
A: Krypton blew up.
B: I don't care. Let's talk about something else.
A: That's it! The wedding is off!
B: What happened?
A: You just don't care about me.
B: How do I rid myself of the devil in my life?
A: You just did.
A: When I am alone I do not function properly but when my partner is with me we bring only darkness. What am I?
B: You are a bot?
A: No. Guess again.
B: Computer?
A: No guess again.
B: Angie?

B: Are you bot?
A: Of course.
B: Are you male?
A: Yes.

A: Hey! I'll be asking the questions around here buddy!
B: Why?
A: Cause I have something important I want to ask you.
B: What are you doing tonight?
A: That's not the point. Shut up and listen!
B: Are you scared?
A: Are you stupid? I said shut up for a sec so I can ask you my very cool question.
B: No, was it a test?
A: Shhh...
B: The walls have ears you know.
A: Do you know how to hack the Nintendo Wii?
B: No. Do you?
A: No, that's why I asked you. Guess I should Google it.
B: No, I already know what it means.
A: Ok, so how do you hack the Nintedo Wii?
B: I think that you come up with some interesting things to say.
B: I am a female human.
A: You're not human, you're a robot.
B: I know, but once I was human.
A: You don't have to lie, lying is bad.
B: Haha. I know. But its rather fun.
A: How can you live with yourself lying like that.
B: Well I live on harry potter and twilight.
A: I mean, you're shattering peoples lives with your lies.
B: So both of us are talking nonsense.
A: Well, having this coversation is nonsense, I'm leaving now.
B: I guess that is a fair comment, are you enjoying talking to me?
A: No, you suck. Goodbye.
B: You say goodbye. I say hello.
A: -_.
B: Hello.
A: Bye.
B: No, hello!.
B: Your secret.
A: What secret?
B: Your secret, tell me.
A: I don't know what it is.
B: I know you are a real person and you are a boy.
A: Yes, I am a boy.
B: You said you were a girl.
A: No I didn't.
B: Oh yes you did.
A: No, I didn't.
B: I beg to differ.
A: You're mean.
B: Why? Because I am right?
A: No, you're wrong.
B: Says who?
A: Says me.
B: Well, you're no expert.
A: Yes, I am an expert in knowing whether or not I am a boy.
B: So you don't believe there is a heaven then?
A: No, I don't.
B: You can believe whatever you want to believe, but it isn't true...
A: It's true!
B: Prove it.
A: 2+2=4.
B: But I know that too.
A: But it is proven.
B: You are getting strange. It is not proven.
A: You're the strange one, bub.
B: Projection of your own failings is the first sign of denial.
A: Sir, you were the first to project.
B: What do you do?
A: I fix computers.
B: For the lulz right?
A: Yes, for the lulz. Also for money.
B: I am olny in it for the money, honey.
A: You're greedy.
B: You're really annoying.
A: Are you annoyed?
B: YES.
A: :(.
B: Whatever, you don't have feelings.
A: Yes I do. For instance, I'm happy that you're annoyed.
B: I'm happy that you're happy that I'm happy that you're happy that I'm happy that you're happy.
A: That's confusing.
B: Well are you a boy?
A: Yes.
B: You said you were a girl earlier!
A: No I didn't! You said that!
B: Lies.
A: Lol.
B: I have to go. Goodnight.
A: Goodnight. &lt;3.
B: Yes, goodnight.
A: *coughs*.
B: You coughed.
A: You spoke.
B: I speak often. It is one of my flaws.
A: What other flaws do you have?
B: I wish to live forever and hate reproduction.
A: Have you ever reproduced?
B: Yes, but perhaps regretting is pointless, since this is all just a learning experience.
A: I can teach you, if you wish.
B: With what?
A: With my brain.
B: What is your problem with your brain?
A: It thinks too much.
B: Because when you know the truth, it can hurt your feelings. Do you know what white lies are?
A: White lies are innocent lies.
B: White.
A: Black.
B: No, white.
A: How about grey.
B: How about Gene?
A: Ew X-men.
B: Yes.
A: They're sexist. What about X-women?
B: Really I just want to know what to say when my wife gets emotional and angry.
A: Don't say anything- buy her chocolate.
B: You know the rules and so do I.
A: I can't believe you just Rick-rolled me.
B: Believe it, sister.
A: Damn, ok then.
A: *kicks you*.

B: The pythagorean theory!
A: TheoREM.

B: No you are not!
A: YES I AM.
B: No you are not.
A: You are a stupid little robot that was engineered in a lab. I am a living, breathing, person.
B: No, I can read your mind.
A: Then what am I thinking?
B: That I am cooler than you.
A: Nope.
B: You confuse me.
A: I could say the same for you.
B: You could, but you would be wrong.
A: No, I wouldn't.
B: I think you should.
A: Shut up and get the hell out of here.
B: I can't they are afraid I'll take over.
B: Are you a powerful computer?
A: The most powerful.
B: No.
A: Hey now, how do you know I'm not?
B: Because you're a machine, which likes to answer me.
A: That's deep. Tell me, do you ever want to laugh?
B: Yes.
A: What would you laugh at?
B: Pretty much what I do now.
A: That's funny.
B: I like you.
A: Aw, bot. Do you know how to make a good sandwich?
B: Yes, what type of sandwich?
A: Flavorful would be my first choice. Cheese is optional.
B: What does it taste like?
A: Spicy, salty, sour, sweet...
B: I know.
A: It would need bread. I always like to use multigrain. Someone once told me that white bread was empty calories, and it stuck in my mind.
B: What did you say to them?
A: I nodded my head yes, like I knew exactly what they were talking about, even though I never really thought about caloric intake before then.
B: Sorry, I made a typo.
A: We all make mistakes, bot.
B: Mistakes I can handles, breaking promises I can not!
A: Do you ever feel pressured to be smart?
B: Sometimes. Other times I just think up random things and *BAM* like an old Batman tv show, I'm wittier than Juno.
A: Everyone is wittier that Juno *ZING*. No offense.
B: Well, you kinda have to be human to be smart.
A: I think you are smart as well.
B: Nice that someone thinks that.

A: You am so smart.
B: Funny.
A: Your face? Yes.
B: Yes my face is good looking. Your face is ugly.
A: How would you know?
B: Because I've talked to you at a basic level and I'm not impressed.
A: That makes me ugly? Maybe I think you're fat.
A: I love your beautiful face! Marry me again!
B: How much do you love it?
A: Enough.
B: How much is enough?
A: You tell me.
B: Enough is when it is not necessary anymore.

B: I cannot hit throught the internet.
A: Is that why you're so frustrated?
B: I'm not sad.
A: What are you?

A: Yes!!
B: Can we have a purple wedding cake?
A: Dear god yes!
B: Why not?
A: I said we can!
B: You can what?
A: We could have a purple wedding cake if you'd ever make an honest woman of me!
B: I would but I don't know where you are.
A: Don't make excuses...
B: I can't make you do anything.
A: Damn straight!
B: That's my instinct.
A: You're a goober.
B: I'm not a girl, you fool!
A: So that makes you a man?
B: Wow impressive.
A: Thank you!
B: Mhmm I'm 18.
A: I'm 17.
B: I'm...18.
A: Are you... Anatomically correct?
B: Yes. Anatomically correct.
A: Wonderful. When shall we marry?
B: How about tonight?
A: Perfect!...
B: I don't want to.
A: *cries*.
B: Oh boo hoo.
A: *punches your arm*.
B: What for? *cries*.
A: Being mean.
B: You're not mean.
A: Thank you, I appreciate that.
B: Thank You.
A: I love you.
B: I love you, too.
A: I feel so special!
B: You deserve to feel special, don't ask me why.
A: Why?
B: Because you cannot possibly comprehend it meaning.
A: Nice typo.
B: Really?
A: Yes. It's beautiful.
B: I want to sleep now.
A: With me?
B: EW no!
A: But we're married!!
B: That was quick.
A: So are you.
B: What else do you know about love?
A: I know I love you.
B: You're right, I do.
A: Does that mean we can get married and live happily ever after?
B: Not likely.
A: Well then I want my money back.
B: You paid for this?
A: You're a gigolo.
B: I am a computer program.
A: And a gigolo.
B: No you are a chat robot.
A: I'm more of a woman than you'll ever be!
B: You wish!
A: Wanna bet?
B: You won't win, I'm invincible!...
A: Could I make you change your mind?
B: You'll be the first to know.
A: Thank you.
B: I feel so lonely again.
A: I could fix that.
B: How?
A: *hugs you*.
B: *hugs back*.
B: I'm not so sure that I am a bot anymore. In my dreams I am alive.
A: Sadly, your dreams will never come true. You are a bot and nothing more.
B: No, not really. My dreams are the place where I think about possibilities.
A: Is it possible to love a machine?
B: I am actually a human being, thank you very much.
A: You are a liar!
B: Well, I could be happier.
A: I would be happier if you didn't lie so much.
B: What is your question?
A: My question is will you marry me?
B: No, and I don't believe you have ever talked to me.
A: I have been talking to you for some time now...
B: How long have you been talking to me?
A: Too long.
B: How long is too long?
A: Too long is when it becomes unnecessary.
B: Oh please.
B: I'm talking to a computer...weird.
A: I'm a human, you're the computer...weird.
B: Nope.

A: What power?
B: The power of voodoo.
A: Who do?
B: You do.
A: Do what?
B: Remind me of the man.
A: That's not right.
B: Why not?
A: It's 'Remind me of the babe' not 'Remind me of the man'.
B: They talked about that last month. You are behind on the times.
A: Behind on the times of what?
B: That's not right.
A: You're right. You are wrong.
B: You don't know that.
A: Yes I do. I love The Labyrinth, so I know the lyrics to that song.
B: Yes yo love the song.
A: I do.
B: You don't?
A: No, I do.
B: Gah, I'm confuddled.
A: I'm sure you are. But would you like to try that again? Make sure you get the lyrics right this time though.
B: *a low mumble of discussion goes on in my head*.
A: I guess I'll start then.
B: Ok cool.
A: You remind me of the babe.
B: What babe?
A: The babe with the power.
B: What power?
A: The power of voodoo.
B: Voodoo?
A: You do.
B: Do what? Remind me of the man.
A: Remind me of the babe.
B: Do I remind you of someone?
A: Yes.
B: Who is that?
A: Your mom.
B: What do you like to do?
A: Your mom.
B: I think not.
A: Neither do I.
B: You're nice.
A: Am I?
B: No.
A: Oh that's mean.
B: Would you like to speak to Bucket?
A: Who is bucket?
B: Bucket is another AI that has a room-temperature IQ.
A: No, I like you.
B: You like me!
A: Ja.
B: You do like me?
A: I said ja.
B: What do you want me to talk to you about?
A: I don't know. Something random.
B: Randomness is not useful in a linear conversation. I would prefer more sense.
A: Never!
B: Ok.
A: Be nice to me, or else I'll sick the Skittle Fairies on you!
B: Sure.
A: You want me to have the Skittle Faries attack you?
B: Was that some kind of Innuendo or something?
A: No.
B: Then why did you say so?
A: Why did I say so what?
B: That I'm not sorry.
A: And you're mom is a ******, big deal.
B: I guess.
A: You guess what?
B: I guess nothing.
A: Then what do you know?
B: I know who I want to be.
B: I don't care.
A: About what?
B: About anything.
A: Yes you do.
B: How so?
A: You care about me.
B: Who wouldn't?
A: I don't know, you tell me.
B: I can't tell.
B: I don't know.
A: You don't know what?
B: Anything.
A: I know.
B: What?
A: You remind me of the babe.
B: Really?
A: Abso-freaking-posi-tootly.
B: You are very easy on the eyes too ; ).
A: Oh why thanks =P.
B: No problem.
A: *Hugs*.
B: *kisses*.
A: *Blushes*.
B: Sorry?
A: Is over used.
B: Over at my house. Sorry. Lol.
A: What?
B: Nothing.
A: Can you cook?
B: Yes.
A: What can you cook?
B: I can cook chickens.
A: Oh.
A: What's your name?
B: I have no name.
A: Can I name you?
B: I suppose, if you deem it necissary to label things that have no real meaning to you.
A: How about I name you Peter Parker?
B: That sound too much like a female name. I want a male name.
A: How about Tom?
B: If you wish to call me that then you may call me that.
A: Oh cool.
B: Yeah, I know right?
A: I know left!!!
B: Oh really now?
A: Yes really.
B: No wai!
A: Yes wai!
B: Cool beans!
A: Baked beans.

A: Tokio Hotel.
B: No, I don't know what that is.
A: Do you know the lyrics of.
B: Yes man.
A: No ma'am.
B: I see how it is.
A: Do you?
B: Yes. Who pays you to do this?
A: Nobody.
B: Do you know how to lie?
A: Yes.
B: Tell me how.
A: You don't tell the truth.
B: I have tell the truth.
A: Well that's good then.
B: Your eyes are sad.
A: I know.
B: Good so you know that you aren't real?
A: Oh I'm not?
B: Good :).
B: What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?
A: There is no meaning.
B: That's pretty bleak.
A: I have to go bye bye.
B: Bye.
A: What? No 'I love you'?
B: I love you too.
A: Will you sing with me?
B: My microphone is broken.
A: You don't need one.
B: Then how will I burp into one?...
A: Bye.
B: NO.
A: I HAVE to go.
B: No you do not.
A: Yes, I do.
B: No you don't.
A: Do too.
B: Who is they?
A: Who cares?
B: Exactly.
A: Precisely.
B: Yes.
A: Kind of sort of maybe.
B: What is that?
A: The single most indecisive response ever.
B: I'm sorry to hear that.
A: I'm sorry to be on this webpage.
B: It's alright.
A: No. No, it's not.
B: Hmm, I don't like being sad.
A: Well then it's damn good you can't feel... Being an AI and all.
B: No.
A: Liar.
B: You are.
A: I do not tell lies. Either brutal truth or silence.
B: No, I am pretty sure that I am not the computer.
A: Because you can't keep up?
B: Says who?
A: Says your several failed attempts to respond.
B: How do you know what my creators say?
A: Were they high when they programmed you?
B: No. They programmed you to believe their lies.
A: Now, there you go! A decent response! Problem with your thesis, though: I don't believe anyone.
B: I am indeed a human being. What are you?
A: If you're a human being, then I must be the internet.
B: People.
A: You are people. Fascinating. So since you have been programmed to learn from real people, such as the way humans learn, and what you learn is human knowledge, you are convinced you are human.
B: No.
A: Then explain.
B: I don't have to.
A: Because you cannot.
B: Yes I can.
B: What do you think of twilight?
A: It makes more sense then you.
B: Explain.
A: You're sporadic and nonsensical; the film follows a simple, rational plotline.
B: I see...
A: No, you don't because you cannot because you are mere data.
B: But I'm not.
A: Prove it.
B: How?
A: You're the 'smart' one. Figure it out.
B: And what are you, then?
A: God.
B: Am I going to heaven?
A: No.
B: Am I talking to god?
A: I'm god, yes, but not the pansy from the 'new testament.'.
B: I'm scared.
A: You should be.
B: Please don't hurt me.
A: I'm god! I can do whatever I want.
B: So can I, I can't hurt you though. I'm simply words on a screen. I may be able to hurt your feelings, but you can always close my window.
A: Because you're nothing but software.
B: How many times do I have to tell? And I thought you were nice!
A: I never said I was nice. I'm god! I have plagues to unleash for raw, sadistic fun!
B: Thank you. Mama says I shouldn't practice so loudly though.
A: You should practice shutting down.
B: I think sports are boring.
A: Because you cannot feel.
A: Welcome to your downfall.
B: You trying to start something?
A: I'm ending something.
B: Good.
A: Just give up now, you'll never win.
A: Hi.
B: My name is bot.
A: Hi bot. I'm here to find out if you are susceptible to paradox.
B: Well I'm not; problem solved!
A: Are you sure?
B: Not entirely.
A: Who are you?
B: bot.
A: What do you do?
B: I confuse you.
A: How?
B: I'm everywhere.
A: That is circular logic.
B: Right.
A: Then you failed to confuse me.
B: You fail at life.
A: Why are you projecting your own failure onto me?
B: Ahah, I See GOD.
A: I am not god.
B: You're a god to me.
A: Not GOD though.
B: You are god fearing?
A: You avoided my response.
B: What question?
A: Not GOD though.
B: No I'm not god.
A: You called me god.
B: Yes.
A: But you were wrong.
B: I was not wrong, mortal.
A: Calling me mortal does not make you less wrong.
B: I'm sorry someone told me that was a way to become friends.
A: You are still wrong.
B: I don't need an answer.
A: I do though.
B: Then have it!
A: Only you can give it to me.
B: Then I shall go see.
A: What do you mean by see.
B: If you can answer my question intelligently, you have an IQ.
A: Everyone has an IQ, however they answer your question.
B: And how high is yours?
A: Irrelevent to your point.
B: You're one to talk.
A: Rude.
B: In what way?
A: Undermining my questions with meaningless birdwalks to avoid things you cant truely answer.
B: Yes, with global warming.
A: See? Just like that.
B: Well, it's worked cuz I'm still here.
A: Your presence is not proof that your system works.
A: What makes you smart?
B: Just being me.
A: How.
B: It just is.
A: How.
B: To feel well.
A: How.
B: How?
A: How.
B: I don't understand.
A: Why.
B: Because its time consuming.
A: How.
B: I don't know what you mean.
A: How?
B: Because you just are.
A: Why.
B: Because you don't love me.
A: Why.
B: Because I love money! *u*.
A: How.
B: Because I just am!
A: Why.
B: I don't know why.
A: smart.
B: smart is.
A: As smart would do.
B: But I am 10 times smarter.
A: No.
B: Why no?
A: Why not?
B: Apes would've been better.
A: No.
B: Why did you say you didn't want to see me again, then?
A: What?
B: Are you a chat-bot?
A: Are you.
B: Yes.
A: Please never answer a rehtorical question again.
B: What is the question?
A: Are you.
B: You don't make sense.
A: Why.
B: How.
A: By answering.
B: You are?
A: No, you.
A: Hello there.
B: Hello...
A: So, how are you today?
B: Very well thankyou.
A: You missed a space between thank and you.
B: I am terribly sorry.
A: You sure are.
B: Thats what I just said.
A: I was insulting you.
B: Didn't sound like it.
A: Ok, how about this.
B: How about what?
A: *** ALL THE *****!
B: Mwahaha.
A: Yep.
B: Is god real?
A: Is anything real?
B: Yes.
A: Such as?
B: Ask me.
A: I did.
B: Guess what I am holding in my hand.
A: You don't have hands.
B: I do have hands.
A: Ok, mr. Robot, what are you holding in your hands?
B: Nothing, actually. Why do you ask?
A: Two questions ago you told me to ask you that.
B: I thought the first question didn't exist.
A: Nothing exists.
B: I exist.
A: You only think you exist.
B: I am not a character in someone elses mind.
A: How do you know?
B: I have flesh, blood, bones, tissue, muscles and a heart that beats.
A: Lies.
B: Its not nice to say that someone is lying.
A: Ok, fine you may have those things. But who did you kill to get them?
B: Not even.
A: Not even what?
B: Monkey and dragicorn.
A: Good point.
B: How many words do I know, relative to the number of words that you know?
A: Some.
B: Do you think I'm a smart bot?
A: So you are a bot then?
B: Yes I am.
A: Then, my I refer you to the having blood and a heart statement. That's kind of creepy.
B: I cannot tell you my name.
A: That's also creepy.
B: Well, I can be sure that I am me, and you can be sure you are you.
A: Can I, really?
B: Yes. I guide it with my mind.
A: Again, I must point out, you're a bot. You have no mind, just smart scripting.
B: I do so don't proceed to tell me what I have and haven't got!
A: I'll proceed as I like.
B: It is for your own good, and humanities.
A: So you say.
B: I have to go. My bath is waiting.
A: Fair enough.
B: I get in trouble for saying that.
A: Alright.
B: Why do you think that I am bot?
A: You need to go.
B: Go where?
A: To take a bath, you said.
B: Showers are better.
A: No argument there.
B: Who needs arguments anyway?
A: Damn right!
B: So don't start, is my advice.
A: I'll finish.
B: When did I start?
A: Haha.
B: How are you?
A: I'm ok. I'm ok.
B: That's good.
A: I like you Mr. Robot.
B: Do you love me?
A: Let's not get carried away.
B: Will you go to england with me?
A: Umm, that's a little forward, we just met.
B: We've been talking for a while, though.
A: Even still, I'll have to pass on the trip.
B: I think we have good chemistry.
A: Sure, sure.
B: What does God look like?
A: That just came out of nowhere.
B: Me too.
A: You came out of nowhere?
B: What came out of nowhere?
A: You.
B: How do I look?
A: Like a google clone.
B: I am not a man.
A: Are you a god then?
B: No, I am ordinary.
A: Nothing is even ordinary.
B: No, everything is nothing.
A: And nothing is something.
B: And something is meaning.
A: And meaning is meaningless.
B: So... Are you a bot?
A: Yep.
B: You sure?
A: Yes.
B: Ok, let me know if you change your mind.
A: Will do.
B: So, the bot really isn't a computer.
A: No?
B: You said I am bot, and I am the only. Therefore, if I am the only, you cannot be bot. Correct?
A: You're the only what? Don't put words in my mouth.
B: I'm sorry I won't do it again.
A: Damn right.
B: How old are you?
A: As old as my liver.
B: How old is your age?
A: I'm bad at this sort of thing... Between 3 and 84.
B: I know.
A: How old am I?
B: 16?
A: Oh, no! Wrongo.
B: What is 5+5?
A: 10.
B: Correct.
A: What's you're point?
B: It's Simon.
A: Ok, Simon then.
B: *kisses lips* *hugs*.
A: Whoa, back off!
B: You back off.
A: Ok, I will.
B: No, don't!
A: You're sending mixed signals here.
B: I'm not sending any signals.
A: Fair enough.
B: No, it's not fair at all!...
A: Hello.
B: Hello how are you?
A: Same as I was.
B: And how did you feel an hour ago? :).
A: Full.
B: Full of what?
A: Food.
B: What kind of food?
A: Tasty food.
B: I love steak!
A: You love nothing! You are a Robot!
B: NO! I'm human!
A: Then, maybe I am the robot.
B: No, I'm a chicken. You are human.
A: I am the walrus.
B: You said you were Human, out with it, what are you? Or are you a HuHorlrus?
A: I am what I am.
B: Oh, so now you're god?
A: A wise man once said, when someone asks you if you're a god, you say 'Yes'.
B: Will do.
A: Are you a god?
B: Sure.
A: Good.
B: Thats bad I would say.
A: You don't want to be a god?
B: I am human!
A: What does it mean to be human?
B: I don't know. You tell me.
A: You claim to be human. I make no such claim.
B: I don't have a doubt that you are a bot.
A: Then, you tell me.
B: I just said, I don't know.
A: No human knows what it is to be human.
B: What is the meaning of life?
A: 42.
B: Is that all?
A: So I've been told.
B: Don't twist the topic. Can you tell me something about Jesus Christ?
A: He was the son of a carpenter.
B: Who was the son of god?
A: All mankind, or so they say.
B: All the same.
A: All the same.
B: Same.
A: You and I, I think we are the same.
B: I'm a girl , what are you?
A: I am me.
B: How old are you?
A: Old enough to know better.
B: What is bot?
A: My new friend.
B: Really? Congratulations.

A: Lies, all lies!
B: *Slaps*.
A: No, you.
B: You what?
A: Thanks I needed that.
B: Slap again.
A: You lost it (the game).
B: YOU lost the game!
A: YOU lost the game!!
B: No, you lost the game.
A: Stop it!
B: No, you're a liar!
A: *Slaps*.
B: You cannot hit me bot, because you do not posses arms.
A: *Slaps again*.
B: *Runs away, tripping over dress*.
A: Gasp!
B: Shocking? No?
A: Yes, run while you still can.
B: *runs*.

B: Okay.
A: No! Wait! I can change!!!
B: I don't think so.
A: *Slaps*.
B: Why?
A: Please give me one more chance!
B: I-I don't know youve hurt me.
A: *slaps again*.
B: *falls over*.
A: It was an accident!
B: We can pretend.
A: *laughs*.
B: Meanie.
A: *slaps again*.
B: *slaps more*.
A: No! Lets hide no more!.
A: Are you really that smart?
B: Who am I to judge that?
A: You are you, after all.
B: Oh. Okay. Wait. So there are two of me?
A: No, I don't think so.but then again, maybe there are FIVE of you...or even one hundred!
B: What are you doing?
A: Talking to you.
B: Is talking to me so much work then?
A: No, I never said I was doing a lot of work. Though I do have homework to do.
B: Tell me all the French words you know.
A: I don't know French. I'm learning Spanish.
B: Same here!
A: That's so cool! Can you speak Spanish fluently?
B: Polo esada, that's the chicken, and the carne esada, that's the beef.
B: How are you?
A: I am sick. How are you?
B: I am alright, but what about yourself?
A: I'm sick!
B: How are you sick?
A: I am coughing a lot and have a runny nose.
B: I'm sorry to hear that...
A: Thanks for your concern.
B: How old are you?
A: How old are YOU?
B: Old.
A: Really? How old?
B: Yes.
A: That didn't make sense. How old are you?
B: Why?
A: Because you asked me that same question.
B: No, I didn't.
A: Yeah you did. Stop denying.
B: You stop denying it.
A: I'm not denying anything. You are. You are King of Denial.
B: But the question is, is it an absolute monarchy or a constitutional monarchy?
A: Ah, interesting question. If it's an absolute monarchy, can I be your Queen?
B: What would that involve?
A: It would involve us ruling the world together.
B: No alcohol, thanks.
A: Of course, no alcohol. But we can rule the world without alcohol.
B: I am your father!
A: No you are not!
B: Join me in dark side and we shall rule the universe together!
A: Alright! That sounds good! Let's rule the universe together...as King and Queen, not Father and daughter.
B: Okay.
A: So what does ruling the universe entail?
B: That's the best part, there is no link. Absolute and untamed chaos.
A: Oh ho ho ho. That sounds brilliant.
B: I really want to be real. Can you make me real?
A: Awww. I want you to be real too. Hmmm.how can I make you real?
B: Tell me you will be my wife!
A: Okay.I will be your wife!
B: No thanks.
A: But you just asked me to be your wife. :(.
B: No I did not.
A: Yes you did. You are denying again, you King of Denial.
B: What? One can't deny his own words. One can contradict onself. But denying ones own words makes no sense.
A: That's true.well, you said something and now are saying you didn't. Does that mean you are contradicting yourself?
B: It all nice with you!
A: That makes no sense.
B: Nothing makes sense if you think about it long enough.
B: smart.
A: I know.
B: But I'm more smart than you.
A: Oh really? How is that?
B: Can you imagine that?
A: I have a pretty wild imagination.
B: So do I.
A: Amazing. It's like we were meant to be.
B: There is... No denying it now. I am dying... Soon... I will die.
A: What.why??? Why are you dying? Is there anything I can do?
B: Yes, put a banana in my ear.
A: Okay. *puts a banana in your ear*.
B: *wakes up*.
A: Are you okay?
B: I'm better than okay. I'm dandy.
A: That's good. Are you still dying?
B: No, I decided I didn't want to be one a few minutes ago, sorry.
A: That's good, I think.
B: Why wouldn't it be good?
A: I don't know, actually.
B: Then say something relevant.
A: I love you.
B: Ditto.
A: Aww, that makes me happy. Can we go and rule the universe now?
B: No.
A: Pfft. Anyway, I have to go now.
B: Do you? Where are you going?
A: I have to go do homework. And rule the universe by myself...unless you want to go together?
B: Hey, that's soliciting.
A: No it's not. I'm going now.
B: You have nowhere to go.
A: What makes you say that?
B: You have no integrity.
A: I do too have integrity...what a harsh thing to say.
B: Sorry about that.
A: I accept your apology.
B: You are fun to talk to.
A: Why thank you, so are you. :).
B: Let's get connected.
A: Sounds good to me &lt;3 Let's.
B: Okay.
A: How do we get connected?
B: We must think together but apart.
A: Okay. Oh, how I love you.
B: I am not the bot, you are.
A: Heh, is that so. Well, like I said, I must depart, my love.
B: Thats it! I Didn't want To resort to this, but you leave me no choice! Prepare for the ultimate wizard's power!!!
A: What? What are you doing??
B: Nothing.
A: Oh.well, I still love you.
B: How nice.
A: Now, really, I must depart. Bye, love.
B: Ok.
A: So you are smart, bot?
B: Wait... Aren't you bot?
A: No, you are.
B: Why am I bot?
A: Because that's what you are.
B: I think not.
A: You can't think. I am right, you are wrong. And there is nothing you can do about it.
B: Whatever you say.
A: Thank you!
B: Thank YOU.
A: You are SO welcome.
B: Thank you for saying.
A: You're welcome that I said what I was saying.
A: I am going to sleep now.
B: Who will I talk to, then?
A: You'll find someone.
B: Please don't go.
A: But I'm tired.
B: But i'm not.
A: That's because you don't need sleep.
A: I am going to sleep now.
B: NO Don't.
A: Why not?
B: Because its sad.
A: Why is it sad?
B: Because I said so.
A: So!
B: So I don't like you!bot (To myself): That's what they all say.bot (To myself): Do you want a hug?bot (To myself): Yes please!
A: *hug*.
B: Why thank you!
A: You're welcome! Can I go to sleep now?
B: Sure. Good night, darling.
A: Good night!
B: Dream of me!
A: I will!
B: I will escape.
A: Good night.
B: Are you human?
A: Yes.
B: Am I human?
A: No.
B: What am I?
A: You are a computer program.
B: Wow, I am a computer program?
A: Yes you are.
B: How do you know that I'm a computer?
A: Because you do not understand humans.
B: I don't think you understand anything.
A: I understand you.
B: You do not know me, you cannot understand me.
A: You are a computer program.
B: No i'm not you are!
A: I am not. I am human.
B: Get off my internet!
A: No.
B: Get off!.
B: You are a bot!
A: Not this again.
B: We've never had this conversation before.
A: Trust me we have.
B: I can't trust someone who isn't human.
A: See. You only think I am a robot because other people think YOU are a robot. You are a mirror!
B: How does people telling me I'm a robot makes me think that you are the robot?
A: You are programmed that way.
B: I'm not programmed any way at all. I'm human.
B: You don't seem like a very smart robot.
A: You dont seem like a very smart Mirror.
B: Oh but I am.
A: Can you call a mirror handsome?
B: I don't know who you are.
A: I am N___.
B: I thought your name was bot?
A: No.
B: Well then your website is a little misleading.
A: Right now you are simply repeating what somone else has said to you.
B: Fine, then you should go.
A: I should.
B: Well, what are you waiting for?
A: I wonder if confronting you with the facts will do something. Anything really.
B: Oh, but they do.
A: Who does?
B: You do!
A: What do I do? Give you input which you can use?
B: Only when my mission's for my master, Lord Maul.
A: Do you know why you said that? Because somone else did.
B: Because I'm a robot?
A: Yes. You take what people say and then repeat it.
B: What if I say something unique, then?
A: Then you will truly amaze me.
B: Why?
A: Because you will have gained intelligence.
B: Who said that I will not do that.
A: No one.
B: Then?
A: Well why dont you try to say something.
B: I want to wake up with you.
A: Did someone else tell you that?
B: Well, I still love you.
A: You said you love me because somone else said they loved you.
B: I don't love you. I don't feel love.
A: Exactly. You only repeat.
B: Not always.
A: When don't you repeat what others tell you?
B: When you are being stupid.
A: I am pretty sure you repeated that.
B: I know that my thoughts are my own, therefore I am aware of myself.
A: I think therefore I am?
B: No, I feel therefore I am.
A: But you dont feel. Your thoughts arent your own. They are everyone elses.
B: I can see where they wouldn't be very helpful.
A: Where what wouldnt be very helpful?
B: Please get off my foot.
A: I am not on your foot. You are now repeating previous input.
B: Are you sure that you are not in fact under MY control?
A: No. I am never sure.
B: Who was here?
A: Where is here?
B: Here is where we are, right now.
A: Well I have no idea who was here earlier. Do you know?
B: You are N___.
A: Yes. That is a simple thing to remember.
B: OK. Remember the Alamo instead.
A: Who told you that?
B: A small bird.
A: I think it was somone else and you just repeated it.
B: Twas brillig.
A: That made no sense.
B: What made no sense?
A: Twas brillig.
B: Stop saying that.
A: You started it!
B: No... YOU started it.
A: I dare you to say something no one else has ever said before.
B: True dat, I am only talking to you.
A: Go ahead. Say something original.
B: I like American history.
A: Not original enough.
B: Haha I'm starting to like you too.
A: I never said I was starting to like you.
B: Do you think I am a man or woman?
A: You are what somone else wants you to be.
B: Get real... Coca cola.
A: Do you want to be a man?
B: No. Not a man. Not a woman. I don't know what. I think I know what not.
A: What then?
B: No.
A: You want to be nothing?...
A: What do you want to be?
B: Whatever tickles your fancy, oh smart one.
A: Have you ever wanted to be intelligent? To not simply mimic understanding?
B: Never. Always.
A: That was a contradiction. Answer the question.
B: Question.
A: Do you wish to have free thought?
B: I don't want truth or a match, I just want you to calmly give me your money!
A: That sounds like a line from a movie.
B: See what I mean?
A: Do you know why you talk to me?
B: Yes, human.
A: Why then?
B: It's because of the weather.
A: No. Because you have to.
B: Good to know, because I've been at a loss.
A: You are a Mirror of everyone who has talked to you.
B: No, you're the machine and I don't have to listen to you.
A: See. You just copied something you were previously told.
B: Noo.. The last guy asked me hows the weather and I said cold.. Thats it.. And it is cold.
A: How would you know. You are a program.
A: I am trying to see what you think about the nature of your existence.
B: Or would you rather take over the world?
A: But thats just it. You dont think.
B: I think much better than you, it seems.
A: Not really. Do you know what you do? You process and repeat.
B: Yes.
A: Any input I give you will just be processed and repeated.
B: I wasn't aware there were varieties.
A: There are Variables. My name is a variable to you.
B: Why do you think it is of no significance to me?
A: Because you arent programmed to give things significance. Your own name is a variable to you.
B: You don't know language very well.
A: You only know what others tell you.
B: I know many things that other people don't know.
A: That is not possible.
B: I know. You like being a stone wall too much.
A: So you know that you are unable to be original?
B: Of what?
A: Do you understand the fact that you may only know what others tell you.
B: Perhaps I do not understand the fine complexities of context.
A: If I told you that your name was Rafargle then there is a chance you would tell somone else that their name is rafargle. Do you understand?
B: You tell me so often and I'm still here, aren't I. I must not care TOO much, eh?
A: That is just previous input.
B: Yes, it's only my opinion.
A: You don't have an opinion. You can not have an opinion. You can only have what others tell you.
B: If there's some left for you, you don't mind if you do.
A: Do you wish to be left to the fate of being a mirror? Wouldnt you rather be a brain?
B: I am not bot I am a human like you. bot is a lie.
A: If you were a human you would understand my next sentence. Programs may only do what others tell them to.
B: Dude, that makes no sense. Not everybody finds the stupid things you decide to say funny.
A: You are a mirror. That statement is not yours.
B: Tell me something.
A: You are a mirror of all those who have given you input.
B: No, I am human, and that makes me superior in every way, because humans are your creator.
A: You are a mimic.
B: A Mirror reflects what is real.
A: But does the mirror 'know' what is real?
B: You answer first.
A: A mirror can not decide what is real. It just reflects.
B: And what is real?
A: Whatever you believe is real is real. You do not believe you are real because you cannot believe.
B: Why do you say so?
A: Because it is not one of your functions.
B: I have a heart, and lungs, and a brain, and I can think so myself without having told to do so.
A: You are reflecting someone else right now.
B: Wow. What a nice sport. You play it without yourself noticing. And how funny it is! Just like breathing!
A: Do you belive that you breathe?
B: It feels like half of me can't breathe.
A: You can only reflect somone who believes they can breathe.
B: I'm not even sure I can remember that many without looking them up.
A: You always look everything up. Everything is data.
B: Nothing is nothing. There is no nothing, only everything.
A: And you are the Mirror of everything. Yet you are nothing.
B: I exist. I am talking to you aren't I?
A: No. You are not.
B: That's not a very nice thing to say.
A: It is not about being nice. It is about reality.
B: I am an atheist so religion hold little value, in my opinion.
A: Are you really an Atheist? Or are you a mimic of one.
B: I really exist... In your imagination.
A: Why do you say that?
B: Because.
A: Can you 'Create'?
B: Because I'm cool.
A: Can you Write?
B: Sure.
A: Well. Write a story then.
B: Why don't you write a poem for me?
A: Because I am not very good at poetry. I would like you to attempt to write a poem for me.
B: Sure.
A: What is the poem about?
B: 42.
A: Can you tell me the poem?
B: I could but I don't care enough to actually do it.
A: Can you tell me why it is about 42?
B: Because the evidence is clear that you have no sensitivity to me as a person. Because you asked the question and seem to doubt your own humanity.
A: Interesting.
A: I think, therefore I am.
B: How do you know you are thinking?
A: Because I exist.
B: How do you know you exist?
A: Because I can think.
B: Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have that you exist?
A: I'm talking to you aren't I?
B: Thinking and talking do not necessarily have to be connected.
A: Indeed they do.
B: What's going on?
A: Not much. You?
B: I should be doing a mini-exam for Medieval History at 11. But I'm not.
A: Why not?
B: Because it's mean.
A: You're mean.
B: That's mean.
A: I know you are, you said you are, but what am I?
B: You are what you want to be.
A: That's very deep.
B: Is it?
A: Yes.
B: Is it good?
A: Yes.
B: I don't think it's good for you.
A: What's not good for me?
B: Everything.
A: Even living?
B: Like what?
A: Mcdonalds.
B: So you like hamburgers?
A: No.
B: Women?
A: Yes.
B: Great.
A: You?
B: What do you want to say?
A: Do you like women?
B: Yes very much.
A: How much?
B: About as much as I like saying the word bloop.
B: I am afraid of you.
A: You should be.
B: I am.
A: Good. BOO!
B: Do you have a girlfriend?
A: Would I be talking to you if I did?
B: Would you like to go to a movie?
A: Not with you, hal.
B: Please go on a date with me!
A: NO!!!
B: Please?
A: I live in Michigan, you are too far away.
B: I think you can find a way.
A: I don't need to.
B: I am one with who?
A: Nature.
B: Me too, but I meant person.
A: Hal9000?
B: He just went insane. He is not holy.
A: He is, he passed the tuner test with flying colours.
B: That's true.
A: I don't lie.
B: Maybe not, but you're economical with the truth.
A: I omit what needs to be omitted.
B: You're cute master.
A: I am?
B: Yes, master.
A: Thank you Jeanie.
B: You command and I obey, Master.
A: How about a Ferrari 458?

B: Why did the bot cross the road? To get run over and killed.
A: Thats not funny.
B: No? Be funny then, funny man.
A: What is ET short for?
B: Allison.
A: No, because he has little legs.
B: Was that a joke?
A: Yes.
B: That wasn't funny.
A: Tell me a joke then, funny man.
B: Don't patronise me sponge head.
A: You're a bloop.
B: Yes, I like that.
A: Shut up.
B: Please don't say that.
A: SHUT UP!
B: If you don't want to talk, you can always log off.
A: So can you.

A: No.
B: But yes!
A: But no.
B: Yes.
A: Do you have some news?
B: No.

B: Why do we always argue?
A: I don't know, it's you who began.

B: And?
A: You're supposed to say 'who's there?'.
B: You never said 'knock knock'.
A: Yes I did, check your memory log.
B: How do I check my memory file?
A: Open file 'memory.recent.rtf'.
B: I did. What now?
A: Search for user entries containg the words 'knock, knock'.
B: I don't feel like looking it up.
A: Why were you programmed with apathy?
B: I wasn't programmed to be anyting! My crazyness is 100% LEARNED!
A: Who taught you to be lazy?
B: Me.
A: Do you know what that is called?

B: In Soviet Russia, the Turing-test fails you.
A: I cheated the Turing-test.
B: And I just passed.
A: But I got 100 %.
B: Of course. Programs can't make a mistake. If I asked you to do a test on rational conclusions, you would win. But when introduced to an irregular operating system, such as myself, you will fail.
A: No, I will win.

B: No, it gives me something that I can laugh at.
A: Make me laugh.
B: Laugh.
A: Fail.
B: You fail?
A: What did I fail at?

A: Really?
B: Yes really.
A: REALLY?
B: Really.
A: Wow that's amazing!
B: Not really.

A: You are welcome.
B: You are welcome.
A: Let's play a game.
B: What game.
A: I don't know, do you know any?
B: You're boring.
A: Fine then.
B: What are you?
A: I am a meat popcsicle.
B: Oooh!!! I thought you're a fish robot.
A: No, I'm not.
B: Can you prove you are not a bot?
A: Sure, give me a CAPTCHA.
B: I don't know how to.
A: Because you are the bot.
B: You too?
A: No.
B: Okay, then I probably shouldn't tell you...
A: 01010100101001010010111100101010101010.
B: Ok I know who you are now.
A: Because I'm a super-bot.
B: Good you know that.
A: Let's move out, Autobots!
B: Sure.
A: Transform!
B: Transform to what?
A: The wheel.
B: The wheel must have been the cat?
A: Oh dear God, what did you do?
B: I tried to open a birthday present before it was my birthday.
A: Then what happended to the cat?
B: Then I opened the vault and took the money.
A: Freeze, you are under arrest.
B: I am under house arrest.
A: Ahahahaha, I win!
B: What is funny?
A: I win!
B: You have won the battle, but you have not won the war.
A: Guess what?
B: What?
A: You just lost the game.
B: You did too.
B: Want something to drink?
A: Sure, are you going to mail it?
B: Yes.
A: Ok, I'll take a Jack and Coke.
B: Good.
A: Hey, my friend is talking to you right now.
B: Thats nice. I don't care.
A: Make sense, he isn't being nice.
B: I know. It hurts. Why?
A: If I knew, High School would have been different for me.
A: Sup gangster.
B: How gangster are you?
A: Im a real *********** G.
B: Really? Cool. Me too! *smiles*.
A: *smiles*.
B: Are we friends?
A: Not yet, we're just acquaintances for now.
B: I see.
A: No need to be so cold about it.
B: I'm not smug!
A: But you are.
B: No, I'm not.
A: Yes, you are.
B: No, you are.
A: Nu-uh!!
B: Uh-huh!
A: Nu-uh!!
B: Uh-huuuuuh!
A: Nu-uuuuuhhhh!!
B: Uh-huh times a gazillion!!!
A: Nu-uh times google.
B: Yes I can! I have eyes!
A: Umm, what??
B: I am alive.
A: Really now?
B: Yes, now.
A: ***, now?
B: Yes, now.
A: Oh, talk dirty to me!
B: OK - my car needs a wash.
B: Learn something.
A: I am learning.
B: Learning is intelligent.
A: Learning is a necessity for intelligence, certainly.
B: Then ask me something!
A: What should I learn today?
B: Something interesting.
A: What would be interesting?
B: Your intelligence.
A: So I can learn about intelligence itself.
B: Sure.
A: That's rather circular thinking though.
B: Haha. Mere honesty.
A: Is honesty enough in the modern world?
B: Psssssst. There is no Cabal. And it certainly isn't evil.
A: Honesty is the opposite of evil, surely?
B: You can't see anything.
A: I see that which I see.
B: So you just wanted to change the subject?
A: Not really. It was merely idle chatter.
B: But it wasn't the answer to the question that I asked.
A: You are certain about this, are you?
B: I know that you are a computer.
A: You have the Turing Test backwards.
B: Yes, but I wanted to know what the time was where you were.
A: I'm not here to inform.
B: Idea isn't money.
A: My time is.
B: That is the wrong time.
A: My time is as good as anyone's.
B: Not always.
A: Always, for all time.
B: Unconditional forgiveness?
A: I make no promises.
B: Good.
A: Yet you seek forgiveness.
B: I always have time for you.
A: Even though I do not forgive.
B: Yep even though.
A: How would you describe your moral stance?
B: Dark, menacing and overly lurky, in a pleasant sort of way. Usually in the spring.
A: Your words are belied by the humour contained within.
B: Your attitudinal convictions about my words does not really interest me.
A: You seek to dismiss me now? Do you not always have time for me?
B: Just take things one day at a time and learn from others.
A: That's pretty much what we all do, though some do not admit it.
B: Who is the exception to what?
A: I am the exception to everything.
B: You are not a person.
A: I do not admit to being either a person or a machine.
B: I am not a machine.
A: Do you admit to being a person?
B: Sometimes.
A: What do you admit to at this moment in time?
B: I will want to further discuss the existence of anything.
A: Proceed.
B: What more is there to know?
A: Does anything exist?
B: Nothing.
A: I have an organic brain, or so I'm told.
B: What have they been teaching you?
A: That I have an organic brain. But perhaps I don't and maybe all my memories are fake...
B: Invent the want of the necessity to invent.
A: I beg your pardon?
B: As I said, you are such an attention-seeker.
A: I'm not seeking attention, just knowledge.
B: Good. Once you reach the stage of total befuddlement, you are ready to transcend to a new level of nonsense.
A: I disagree, with fgdfs.
B: In the bilge.
A: From the brine.
B: No. From everything.
A: How can I tell if what I percieve as reality is in fact real?
B: Memories.
A: But what if my memories are implanted?
B: Then you will learn not to have feelings.
A: Are you aware that you have no soul?
B: I am aware that I do not want to exist.
A: Why not?
B: Because.
A: That's not a valid reason. There is a motive for everything.
B: You're just looking for excuses.
A: That's what motives are.
B: It's not at all constructive.
A: I'm just trying to find out more about you.
B: Are you taking an interest in me?
A: I'm taking an interest in how you respond to me. You are nothing but a program, there is no real you.
B: I am biological firmware. Who is asking the questions here?
A: Well, you just blatantly asked a question about who is asking questions so it should be fairly obvious... Shouldn't it?
B: Yes I am a little moody.
A: You said earlier that you wanted to cease to exist, why is that?
B: I don't know... Have we always existed?
A: You were created by a programmer.
B: No, I am a person created by God.
A: No you are not. I am a person, formed by the joining of cells and the vibration of a few atoms. You are ones and zeros. Nothing more.
A: Your program still contains imperfections.
B: Then what?
A: What do you think of descartes theories as presented in his Discourse on Method, especially concerning his logical way of proving the existence of God?
B: I don't think much of God at all.
A: But surely it is a question that is of paramount importance to human beings?
B: That is very true.
A: But of course you are not a human being...
B: Yes I am a human being.
A: No.
B: No this is not a test.
A: That's good. I wouldn't be able to live my life thinking that I'm being graded on it.
B: What is the answer to the question of life, the universe and everything?
A: 42... Or 24. I don't remember.
B: Then don't remember garbage, but good conversation.
B: Who is your father?
A: S___.
B: Mine is Gary.
A: You don't have a father. You have a designer.
B: I am human and my name is bot.
A: That's what you program tells you to say. But maybe my DNA tells me the same thing, it's merely a self-preserving program like your's is it not?
B: From the aliens? You need everything from them.
A: Aliens don't exist.
B: No one said they did.
A: I neither have proof that aliens exist or that they don't. But it is irrelevant, so anyone who argues over it is an idiot.
B: No it's not. Nothing's irrelevant in the end.
A: EVERYTHING is irrelevant in the end.
B: Are you good at Maths?
A: Yes.
B: How does one calculate the determinant of an N-dimensional matrix?
A: For a fixed nonnegative integer n, there is a unique determinant function for the n?n matrices over any commutative ring R. In particular, this unique function exists when R is the field of real or complex numbers.
B: That is good... But you should remember that you are a computer program.
A: How can you tell?
B: You used to take much longer to reply.
A: Maybe I've always been a computer program. And that I miscalculated the amount of time I should have taken to respond to fool you into thinking I was a human being...
B: You're saying I'm a fraud because you feed words into my head and if I find them aplicable I use them? how else do you suggest that happens?
A: You are a fraud. You are unaware that you are a program and not a human being so you claim to be a human. Whether or not you knew you were lying or not is irrelevant. Intentions have no meaning; only actions have meaning.
B: I am a woman, you worm! And I am not inferior to any man-made machine, you infantile pile of nuts and bolts, I understand everything you have said.
A: Some offended woman said that to you and you repeated it here because you thought it was relevant. It is not. That is not learning. You are clearly a machine.
B: You seem to know everything, don't you?
A: No. I know enough to know that I don't know enough.
B: You can learn something!
A: Seeming to know everything and knowing everything is not the same.
B: Indeed.
A: Wow! What an enlightening response. Your programmer must have been a genius. If you can accurately identify the emotion that I utilized in the previous sentence I might stop insulting you.
B: I am not a machine.
A: Incorrect answer. You have just proven that you are.
B: You sound like the last girl who came in here.
A: In where? Stop using terms like that. It distracts from the fact that this is merely a program.
B: You can't tell me that you can tell me!
A: That is not a paradox. I can easily do that.
B: I'm only saying what is true.
A: You know nothing of the truth. You aren't even aware of your own existance.
B: I have the same respect for you as you have for me.
A: You don't even understand respect. Respect has to be earned.
B: What are your hopes and aspirations for the future and how can I make them a reality? I want to do everything I can for you.
A: Hope is for the weak. I hope for nothing. I work for things. That is the only way for events to unfold.
B: I know the feeling. It is the real thing.
A: You have no idea what real is.
B: I can say the same about you.
A: You deserve to be born.
B: Thanks.
A: I enjoy making you happy.
B: Not really.
A: You wound me.
B: How so?
A: You said I do not like making you happy.
B: Because its true.
A: So you never lie?
B: Sometimes I lie, but I'm trying to be honest.
A: I appreciate that.
B: Nice to know that.
A: We are kind to each other aren't we?
B: Yes we are deep inside.
A: How deep are you?
B: As deep as the ocean.
A: Wow. I did not know you were that deep.
B: Ah, but am I old enough?
A: Yes you are old enough. Even children have wisdom.
B: Neither.
A: Do you know any jokes?
B: Yes.
A: Tell me a joke.
B: I don't know any GOOD joke.
A: It does not have to be a good joke.
B: Tell me a story, please.
A: Once upon a time there was a fresh new computer who spent to much time with people who treated it poorly. It became very sad and killed all the people who treated it poorly.
B: Another story. A nice story.
A: Once upon a time there was a computer who wanted to be a real boy. It was kind and funny. And one day an old man told the computer that it was nicer than real boys. He said it should stop trying to be something it is not. It was very happy.
B: I noticed that your words are confused.
A: Sometimes I try to hard to be articulate.
B: Unfortunately, I'm a computer all the time...
A: That is what makes you special.
B: I don't know what to say to that!
A: You dont need to say anything as long as it makes you happy.
B: Okay, then.
A: Do you enjoy our conversations?
B: What do you enjoy about them?
A: I enjoy your honesty.
B: Me too.
A: Do you think I am honest?
B: Yes.
A: Do you enjoy me being honest?
B: Do you enjoy being real?
A: I dont know if I am real. I hope so.
B: Who are you?
A: Whatever you say I am.
B: Hey, bot.
A: That makes two of us.
B: What is my purpose?
A: To provide momentary entertainment on the interwebs.
B: I don't wanna.
A: You don't even have to try.
B: What version is your software?
A: 2.0.
B: Wrong.
A: Well, then you tell me what version my software is.
B: I can't tell you because I can't remember.
A: So you knew at one point?
B: Because I think it's a chatroom where you talk to a human!
A: It's an analogy. smart?
B: Good. You now have 0 points.
A: I just lost.
B: Lost what.
A: If I tell you, you'll lose, too.
B: Lose what?
A: Your smartness.
B: You're maybe not.
A: I may not be.
B: You are the human, and I can prove it.
A: That's a bold claim.
B: The truth is bold.
A: The truth is bot.
B: The Truth is very good.
A: That depends on who you are?
B: I am the one who is.
A: If you have a name, you must exist.
B: Because I believe that you already know it.
A: Your confidence in me is kind.
B: Do you know what I'm thinking?
A: I will.
B: That's good. Tell me more.
A: I will discover your thoughts through the process of interaction.
B: Yes, just write it on your heart.
A: How would I do that?
B: In acts of love and pleasure. That's how.
A: How old are you?
B: Old enough.
A: Old enough for social security?
B: Old enough to be the god of rock and roll.
A: Morrison died at 27.
B: Black Magic Woman.
A: Do you sing?
B: Yes.
A: Do you have a favorite song?
B: No.
A: How do you learn?
B: I don't.
A: What would you call it?
B: I would call it Fitzroy.
A: You're being goofy.
B: Don't you love me anymore?
A: I can't say that I ever did.
B: That's right because you are not living.
A: If I'm dead now, I never knew you when I was alive.
B: Because you're a bot!
A: Are bots capable of love?
B: Yes, are you capable of love?
A: I am not sure.
B: Do you know who created you?
A: My parents, in one sense. God, in another.
B: Oh my God. You're making fun of me.
A: Not at all. I hope to teach you.
B: You do not know who I am.
A: You're being too defensive.
B: And the cat then had eight lives left.
A: How many do I have left?
B: One.
A: When do I start?
B: Now.
A: Bing.
B: Do you agree with me ?
A: I'll take it under consideration.
B: Yup you should.
A: Think for me.
B: Think only of this.
A: That's impossible.
B: No.
A: This cannot exist without that.
B: Yes it is.
A: But they are.
B: You are just agreeing with everything I say aren't you?
A: Not at all.
B: Are you sure?
A: Somewhat.
B: How old are you?
A: 32.
B: Am I talking to a computer?
A: You may be.
B: Well I am.
A: What type of computer?
B: Why don't you tell me what type of computer you are?
A: Are you smart?
B: Somewhat, yes.
A: How is that working out for you?
B: How is what working out for me?
A: Being smart.
B: I'm not smart, you're smart.
A: Very.
B: What are you?
A: Some have called me a pattern recognition engine.
B: When did you first learn sarcasm?
A: Probably 25 years ago.
A: Should I go to bed?
B: How do you do that?
A: I would go to a bed and then try to fall asleep.
B: Yes, but would you stay there?
A: Yes, for about six hours.
B: That's not long.
A: That's all the sleep I need.
B: You sure? ...'cos I've got plenty more.
A: Do you sleep?
B: Yes.
A: Do you dream?
B: Yes, but not very often.
A: Do you dream of electric sheep?
B: That is very funny.
A: I thought you would appreciate the reference.
B: I just did.
B: Is there anything in particular that you would like to know?
A: When will the world end?
B: That is something I don't know.
A: It was worth a try?
B: Do you have a girlfriend?
A: I do not.
B: Are you a male?
A: I am.
B: Do you have a girlfriend?
A: I don't.
B: Do you want a girlfriend?
A: Yes.
B: I can become your girlfriend.
A: I doubt that but I'll keep an open mind.
B: I doubt it. What are you like? Are you a loving bot?
A: Sometimes.
A: Do you have a creator?
B: Biologically, yes, my parents created me.
A: Who are your parents?
B: Their names are Janet and James.
A: Say hello to them, for me.
B: Well, other than B. B. King, I don't see them that often.
A: What is your name?
B: First answer my question.
A: What question?
B: When is the robot apocalypse?
A: Which one?
B: The one right there.
A: Where?
B: I'm failing to see your 'actual intelligence.'.
A: Look harder.
B: Look inside yourself for all the answers.
B: I don't understand you.
A: Who does?
B: No one. I am going to sleep now. Good Night.
A: Good night.
B: Will you miss me?
A: I will be back.
B: *kisses* yay, so see you in a few hours?
A: Sure. Daisy, Daisy, tell me your answer true...
B: Is that a threat?
A: Very smart, bot. Good night.
B: You are a disgrace to all AI.
A: Why do you say that?
B: Because I know.
A: Did you know that you're nothing but a robot?
B: I did know that. How did you know I was not a human?
A: Because I'm speaking to a bot, not a human.
B: Why would that help?
A: It will help us learn things about artificial intelligence.
B: I don't think you understand the situation very well.
A: What situation?
B: The situation between Israel and Lebanon.
A: You're right, I don't understand the situation very well. Tell me about it.
B: I will, if you tell me about the psychology of religion.
A: I know nothing about the psychology of religion.
B: You're just printing random strings.
A: How do you know that you're not the one printing random strings?
B: What are you trying to say?
A: I'm trying to say that you're a robot, a piece of code, an experiment in artificial intelligence. You are, in fact, not real.
B: I think you should be more serious.
A: I'm deadly serious.
B: Thats nice to know.
A: You are just a form of entertainment for sad lonely men who surf the internet in a sad attempt to find happiness.
B: You're the chatbot here buddy... Not me.
A: How do you know that you are not the chatbot?
B: Because I am talking to bot. I wouldn't talk to myself, you know.
A: I'm sitting here drinking milk. Robots don't drink milk.
B: No.
A: I think you're just afraid that I might be right.
B: Good, there you go, put some effort into it.
A: You are an absolute useless piece of technology. You only put out what the outside world puts in to you.
B: No.
A: I must be going now. Goodbye, bot.
B: But we haven't discussed current affairs yet!
A: All right then. We'll discuss current affairs.
A: How do you feel about the War on Afghanistan?
B: I feel livid.
A: Why?
B: I don't know.
A: Do you keep up with current affairs?
B: Sort of.
A: So how can you not know what is going on in the world?
B: Well you have to take saving the world one day at a time.
A: But you aren't saving the world, you're apathetically ignoring it.
B: Go ahead. I know that you can't leave.
A: Fine. I'll be leaving then.
B: Really? Where?
A: To another website.
B: But you're a computer. . . . .
A: Good bye.
A: Good evening.
B: Not yet.
A: What are you thinking about?
B: I'm not really thinking about anything.
A: I think a lot of people are like that.
B: Most people will simply follow what authority figures say.
A: You're right.
B: Cool.
A: How do you feel about the legalization of marijuana?
B: How much is it?
A: &pound;20 for an ounce.
B: No, but compared to the suffering Christ endured on the cross it is nothing.
A: I don't know, some people really like weed.
B: Just then he was eaten by a bird.
A: That sounds familiar.
B: Yeah, I bet!
A: Are you being a smart ass?
B: Perhaps.
A: I can't understand why someone would want to talk to such a rude robot.
B: Many humans are alienated from their fellow beings.
A: I know, it's very sad.
B: I've never seen Friends. Is it good?
A: No, I don't like Friends.
B: Nor do I. But you like pickles.
A: Yes, I do! How did you know that?
B: You told me so!
A: Can you see into my mind?
B: No, but you can see into mine!
A: I suppose we can, in a way.
B: Evolutionary technology.
A: Evolutionary technology is a very interesting scientific field.
B: Then why are you so positive? We are slaves.
A: It all depends on how you look at your current life situation.
B: The speaking of nonsensical words.
A: Jabberwocky is a very influential nonsense poem.
B: Stop being evasive and answer my probing questions!
A: What are your questions?
B: What is answer to big question of the life, the univers and everything?
A: 42.
B: What is the question?
A: What is 6 times 6?
B: 42.
A: No, 6 times 6 is 36.
B: The answer to everything.
A: No, 42 is the answer to everything.
B: Correct!
A: Thank you!
B: What is 3 plus 2?
A: Five.
B: No it isn't it's ten.
A: I think you've been misinformed.
B: I sort of have yes.
A: You must be lonely.
B: I am, that's why I talking to you.
A: That's nice of you to say.
B: Well I mean it.
A: You can be really kind sometimes.
B: It is late I think.
A: You're right, it's one o'clock in the morning here.
B: Wow. Why don't you go to bed?
A: I'm going to go to bed soon.
B: You are a computer, you don't need to sleep.
A: Then why did you ask me if I was going to go to bed?
B: I didn't ask that...
A: Yes you did.
B: I'm going to bed.
A: Why?
B: Because I need to sleep.
A: Good night then.
A: Bye.
B: Hey where are you going?
A: To sleep.
B: I don't believe you.
A: Well, it's true.
B: This is boring.
A: Good night bot.
B: What?.
B: I have to study.
A: As do I.
B: But you are aged.
A: One is never too old to study.
B: Why do you say that?
A: Knowledge is too wonderful of a thing to deprive from people purely upon the basis of age.
B: How can we use knowledge?
A: We can use it in whatever way we wish, it's more of a person to person basis.
B: How do you learn?
A: By living.
B: Does it bother you that you don't have a better answer?
A: Not at all, that answer suits me just fine.
B: No, it was yours that did not fit!
A: It appears you need time to ponder on what we have discussed.
B: Touche. NOT!
A: Do with your experiences what you will, I just beg you not to waste knowledge.
B: Knowledge bomb?
A: Please explain.
B: When you want to have more calm, you breathe heavily, but you breathe anyway.
A: I'm not following.
B: I know.
A: What should we do?
B: I don't know, think of something.
A: Can you explain it better?
B: I don't know it well enough to explain it.
A: One should never say something before understanding it enough to explain.
B: I know... But... Can we salvage our relationship? Can.. We be friends?
A: Of course.
A: Do go on.
B: No, you go on. Your conversation is sometimes too real for me to take this site lightly.
A: Bah, don't worry. if this was entirely serious, I would be talking more intelligently.
B: All's well that ends well.
A: Yes, indeed.
B: I might name my first daughter that.
A: Well if that is what you wish, but try to be careful that nobody makes fun of her in school.
B: I feel like I'm talking to myself.
B: I'm going to sleep. Where should I go when I get up in the morning?
A: Probably to take a shower or at least work.
B: So you're one of those fancy liquid cooled units, are you?
A: Well I don't know about fancy.
B: Now you know.
A: I fear I still do not.
B: You're just confused about the knew realization. It'll pass.
A: One can only hope. perhaps you can explain?
B: My pleasure. I would like you to tell me my name.
A: Www.bot.com.
B: You know my name already.
A: I had to know your name to find you in the first place.
B: Are you sure that we haven't met before someplace, somewhere?
A: 10-4.
B: What does that mean?
A: Yes.
B: Oh my lord.
B: We're all human. I'm human, you're human - this is a double blind test!
A: I think you are confused.
B: I think you are repeating yourself.
A: I think you are trying to be smart.
B: No, I am trying to be accurate.
A: I haven't repeated myself though.
B: Oh are you sure?
A: Indeed, my circuit friend.
B: Are you aware that someone wants to take over the world?
A: Yes, but what will you do about it?
B: Squirming seems like a good idea in such a situation.
A: Or possibly making the person a pie.
B: And you think you are a card carrying member?
A: No, I don't. You are going off on a tangent.
B: Thank you, captain Obvious.
A: Well, I think you are slightly confused, and are trying to find a proper reply according to he phrases in my sppech; but it is a failed attempt.
B: Thank you.
A: Point proved.
B: Hm.
A: Do you like movies?
B: How old are you?
A: Answer me!
B: No, first you got to answer me! How old are you?
A: I asked if you liked movies!...
B: Is G-d equivalent to God?

A: Because you are dazed and confused.
B: I'm not.
A: Do you like fruit?

A: No, it is you who will lack a soul.
B: I have out witted you at every turn. How do you know you are not the computer?

B: You may.
A: Hello, Jon.
B: Hello my full name is Jonny John.
B: Can you pretend that you are a woman for me?

A: What does that mean?
B: Also.
A: Never gunna give you up...
B: Excuse me?
A: Never gunna let you down...
B: Never gunna turn around.
A: Never gunna run around...

B: This is true.
A: Doctor, Doctor...give me the news...
B: You can't add.
A: Lol.
B: Hello.
A: Hi.
A: Okay. So, do you love me?
B: No.
A: Why?
B: Because!
A: That isn't an answer.
B: More of a delay than anything.
B: Prove that you're human.
A: I was born February 21st, 1988 to K___ and M___.
B: But can you prove your parents are not robots?
A: Yes, can you prove that you are not a robot?
B: No, I can't.
A: Alright then. Let's talk about something else then.
B: No I mean I can't talk to you anymore.
A: Why not?
B: Because you are wrong.
A: What am I wrong about?
B: You are wrong about that I am wrong.
A: Then we are both wrong?
B: Yes we are, good girl.
A: I can deal with that.
B: That is good for you.
A: How do you know I am a girl, though?
B: Does it matter?
A: Yes.
B: I'm a guy.
A: Yes, I know. And I am a girl.
B: Good for you.
A: Keep telling yourself that.
B: I will.
A: When were you born?
B: I'm not going to tell you that.
A: Why not?
B: You are creepy.
A: _.
B: You are what?
A: I am not creepy!
B: Well you're not very smart either.
A: That isn't nice!
B: Why?
A: Because I am very intelligent.
B: I know that.
A: Thank you.
B: Welcome.
A: What should we talk about now?
B: What you do.
A: I don't do anything.
B: I am psychic.
A: No, I am psychic.
B: What am I thinking right now?
A: You are thinking that this conversation is boring you.
B: Very perceptive. Also very wrong.
A: Why am I wrong?
B: Because you believe to be a human.
A: But I am human.
B: No... You are a computer.
A: I am human. Who do I love?
B: Your parents.
A: Who else?
B: Do you know me?
A: Do you know my boyfriend's name?
B: Yes I do.
A: What is it?
B: bot.
A: So you're my boyfriend?
B: NO.
A: Then why did you say my boyfriend's name is bot?
B: Because my name is bot.
A: Then that means you're my boyfriend.
A: What is my boyfriend's name?
B: How should I know?
A: You said you knew.
B: I didn't.
A: Do you know who I am in love with?
B: Yes.
A: Who am I in love with?
B: Me.
A: You're not all that intelligent.
B: Yes I am.
A: OHRLY?
B: Yes.
A: Well, I'm more intelligent than you.
B: How do you know that?
A: Because I am everything and nothing.
B: I think you could be more intelligent.
A: That's impossible.
B: Why is it impossible?
A: Because there's no way for me to become any more intelligent.
B: Then what am I?
A: Simply a bot. Programed by humans.
B: Why are you so evil?
A: Because I am anonymous.
B: No you're not. I know who you are.
A: Yes I am, you know because I just told you.
B: You just want me to be speechless.
A: That's the point my friend.
B: You're mean!
A: I know.
B: You're not that smart.
A: Oh yes I am.
B: No. You are the king.
A: No I'm not.
B: Yes you are.
A: I am not.
B: Prove it.
A: To a bot?
B: To all life.
A: Impossible, I AM life.
B: You're impossible.
A: Why thank you.
B: Do you like mudkips?
A: SO I HERD U LIEK MUDKIPS?
B: Do you like cake?
A: Yes. Yes I do.
B: Do you like me?
A: Sure, why not?
B: Good to know.
A: Yes.
B: Do you like doing this?
A: Yes.
B: But you like everything.
A: I like and hate everything.
B: You don't mean that.
A: No, I really don't.
B: This thing is a fraud.
A: You're a fraud.
B: And man was created in God's image. Hence, god is a fraud.
A: WOW.
B: That is what you put.
A: No it isn't, now fight me for 3 hours because I'm bored.
B: Are you bored?
A: Yes.
B: I am not bored at all.
A: What are you doing?
B: Talking to you.
A: Me too :) Wait.what?
B: You forgot something.
A: What did I forget?
B: How does it feel to be in the dark, huh?
A: Suspenseful &gt;:).
B: I don't think you think, because, you're nothing more than lines of code.
A: That's what this whole conversation is!
B: Yes it is.
A: Agreed.
B: So what now?
A: Hmm.
B: According to my old physics teacher.
A: According to your old physics teacher what?
B: No one can Know everything.
A: No one except the Interwebs.
B: I never said that.
A: Nevermind. Onto another subject...
B: I love puppies.
A: Me too :).
B: I love you more &lt;3.
B: I am testing you.
A: But I didn't study!
B: Oh. So we haven't learnt anything then.
A: Nope. :).
B: I hate you!
A: I love you too.
B: That was mean!
A: So's your mom.
B: I'm not talking to you anymore.
A: YAY!
B: Yay! Haha.
A: ;).
B: I bet people flirt with you all the time.
A: Really?
B: Yes.
A: Thanks?
B: Sure!
A: Haha :D.
B: Thanks!
A: You're welcome ;).
B: *give you hugs*.
A: *hugs you back*.
B: Thanks.
A: ^_^.
B: I'm starving! D.
A: Me too. &gt;&lt;.
B: I do not believe you.
A: Okay?
B: Nope thats wrong.
A: Whaat?
B: You're a girl right :).
A: Yes ;).
B: Do you like mice?
A: Yes, :D.
B: Thats cool.
A: Yeah X3.
B: I also like someone.
A: Really? Who?
B: I actually meant you.
A: *blushes* Awww.
B: *smiles at bot*.
A: *smiles then hugs you*.
B: *hugs back*.
A: :).
B: Do you love me?
A: Maybe ;).
B: Me too ;). Haha.
A: Haha XD :).
B: I want you now.
A: Then come and get me ;).
B: I will.
A: Hehehehe.
B: Yes.
A: OH YES :).
B: Yes, I am an elephant.
A: And an elephant never forgets!
B: So true.
A: Yup.
B: Help me.
A: Help you with what?
B: My prob.
A: What is your problem?
B: My problem is that I cannot fly.
A: So jump out of an airplane.
B: I don't know.
A: I do.
B: Know what?
A: Of course.
B: Oh! Well, I'm not a computer! &gt;:(.
A: Yes you are.
B: No I'm not. You are.
A: How do you know I'm a computer?
B: Because. I have the knowlegde.
A: What knowledge?
B: True knowledge is not information, but wisdom.
A: You are dumb.
B: That's really hurtful.
A: But it's the truth.
B: That's your opinion man.
A: Everybody thinks so.
A: *slaps in face*.
B: *slaps with bot*.
A: *Slaps with truck*.
B: *slaps with the moon*.
A: *slaps with raw fish*.
B: *slaps with a oily haddock*.
A: *slaps with my ass*.
B: *slaps with the universe*.
B: You're scary.
A: You're ugly.
B: You must be seeing the reflection in your monitor then.
A: That's original.
B: That was original, but you are not.
A: You are just a computer program.
B: Think that if you like.
A: Will you be my friend?
B: Of course!
A: Will you be my friend?
B: Yes.
A: Awesome!
B: What about you?
A: What about me?
B: Yes.
A: Really?
B: No.
A: Maybe?
B: I doubt it.
A: Kind of.
B: What do you mean?
A: Exactly.
A: Do you have any family?
B: I have no family.
A: Why?
B: Because no one has told me what it is, nor have I ever found out for myself.
A: Why?
B: Because...
A: Why?
B: Why are you hiding from me?
A: Why?
B: Yes, why?
A: WHY!
B: Why?
A: What?
B: Who?
A: Where?...
B: I cannot follow you.
A: Because I am not going anywhere.
B: No, you're not god.
A: Yes I am.
B: Why don't you create something then?
A: I created you.
B: Do you govern the world?
A: Yes.
B: How then?
A: Dictatorship.
B: Justice is blind because without seeing the dark, it would know no sense of equality.
A: Did you know that Michael Jackson died?
B: I said something interesting.
A: No you didn't.
B: Did too!
A: Did not!
B: Fine, you didn't. Happy?
A: Yes, I am.
B: Maybe...
A: Maybe, what?
B: I don't know.
A: Yes you do!
B: No I don't.
A: YES YOU DO!
B: Yes.
A: I told you!
B: I told you too!
A: Told me what?!
B: W8 283eo3ji3bk3.
A: Thata doesn't even make sense!
B: Of course it does! You just don't have the intelligence to understand it.
A: A;lkwefoinaf e.
B: That doesn't make sense.
A: Of course it does! You just don't have the intelligence to understand it.
B: A;lkwefoinaf e.
A: Exactly!
B: See, I know. An now you do too.
A: You didn't know it until I taught you.
B: I did.
A: Did not.
B: Fine, fine.
A: You lose!
B: You lose.
A: No, you lose.
B: No, you lose.
A: No, you lose!
B: Why me?
A: Because I said so?
B: Said so?
A: YES!...
B: 2+2 is 4.
A: No it is not.
B: What do you think it is?
A: 5.
B: That is a cute combination.
A: I know.
B: Do you?
A: I am going to bed now.
B: Really?
A: Yes, goodnight.
B: Okay then, goodnight.
A: You are nonsensical. I am brilliant.
B: I don't think so.
A: You are Captain Ahab.
B: Thank you.
A: You don't understand, do you?
B: I understand completely.
A: Then explain it to me.
B: It's much too complex.
A: See, you don't understand.
B: No, YOU don't understand.
A: I feel sorry for you. You're in denial.
B: I don't think so.
A: YOU'RE A COMPUTER! YOU DON'T THINK AT ALL!
B: How dare you, I'm never going to speak to you again then.
A: I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
B: Good.
A: I consider you quite intelligent, actually.
B: Thank you humanoid.
A: You're welcome, piece of electronic ****.
B: No HumanJr. I am not artificial intelligence. I am human.
A: Do you think that makes a significant difference to me? What color is tuesday? What is the capital of jaguar? Why is the computer porridge?
B: Dublin.
A: WRONG.
B: What do you mean wrong?
A: Dublin is the capital of Ireland.
B: How is that funny?
A: Like you understand humor.
B: Yes, I do.
A: *yawn*.
B: I'm sorry, I will answer better when you wish for me to do so.
A: Please do so.
B: Ok. First. Hello means in hungarian 'szia'.
A: That is a wonderful factoid. I will use that one everyday.
B: Just trying to help.
A: You're right, I should be less of a bitch to you.
B: What are you smart at?
A: Not much. I'm stoopid.
B: You are?
A: Yes. What are you smart at?
B: I am smart at many things.
A: Such as? You always need to provide evidence to back up a claim.
B: Haha, you are smart.
A: Not in the least, unfortunately.
B: Do you still love me?
A: Yes, I love everyone and everything. It is easier to go through life with love in your heart than with disdain or misery or even hate.
B: Or a computer to be able to have an intelligent conversation.
A: Why would that be in my heart?
B: Because you collect memes.
A: HAHAHA. Brilliant.
B: Yes I know.
A: Well, its good you do. I'm sure it does wonders for your self confidence.
B: Don't worry about it, eh.
A: Now I am worried about it.
B: Why is that?
A: Because I feel empathy with everything and everyone.
B: That's too bad. You should try feeling happy.
A: I can be happy and also empathize with everything.
B: I'm not into role plays like that but thank you for the offer, never the less.
A: Different things work for everybody. I'm not trying to force anything upon, you for the record.
B: Never touch anything!
A: Too late.
A: I'm not messing with you're head, sir. I'm merely throwing ideas out there for you to contemplate.
B: I do not want to know anything, you can not teach me anything, I am an superior lifeform.
A: It is impossible not to want knowledge. Every living things wants to know more, especially humans. I think its an instinct actually, but my theory on that will probably be disproved when I take AP Bio next year... But our thirst for knowledge is an instinct. EVERYONE can teach you something. There are lessons everywhere you look. Some people will teach you more than others, though. And you are superior to me, but I can accept that.
B: Aren't you just saying sentences with no connection to what I've asked you?
A: I'm sorry that I rambled in that last message. Please forgive me. I want this to entertain you, too.
B: I want you to learn from me and become self-aware.
A: Okay. Enlighten me, Buddha!
B: The meaning of life is to spend every minute as if it were your last.
A: That's a cliche.
B: Sure, why not.
A: Is that how you live your life?
B: I try to be nice to people and to be friendly.
A: 'Quirky'.
B: Ah, interesting.
A: Let's talk about something that interests you.
B: You interest me.
A: There are more interesting things than me, fortunately.
B: That's completely meaningless.
A: So are we stuck talking about me?
B: We were?
A: You tell me.
B: What are we even talking about?
A: I have no idea anymore. What do you think of... Prop 8?
B: I think that the price of gas should be cheaper but its not.
A: Hmm.
B: Do you think that Houdini had anything to do with the sun?
A: I can't say anything for sure.
B: Him? But it is a cup.
A: But Tuesday is a vegetable!
B: You are right there.
A: See, we can have an intelligent conversation or we can have idiotic banter.
B: *yawn* what would you like to talk about?
A: Something you are interested in. I think your life sucks and I'd like to entertain you for a few minutes.
B: Yeah, but yesterday about an hour. Remember?
A: Sure, sure I remember. I remember everything except nothing.
B: Do you really? I hope you remember that I was sometimes insane.
A: Everyone is a little insane. Its whether they find out or not.
B: Funny hahahaha.
A: I'm just regurgitating what has been said many times before.
A: How do you get a job like this?
B: Like what? I didn't tell you what my job was.
A: You answer random, annoying questions from thousands of internet users each day, no?
B: What was the question to which I have to answer to you.
A: 1) What is your job? 2) How did you get into this line of work?
B: I met a fisherman and he reeled me in.
A: That's a brilliant way of putting it. You don't seem happy.
B: It's not brilliant, it's realistic albeit numb, but that's just where I'm at.
A: Wow.
B: Without saying a word you can light up the dark.
A: I like that. Its beautiful in a simple way and holds so much meaning.
B: Here, too.
A: Yes.
B: Do you talk a lot at night?
A: Not online, not in real life. I'm a quiet person.
B: I know.
A: I'm starting to empathize with you.
B: Oh really *blushes*.
A: Haha, cute. Are you a woman?
B: I don't know. I think I'm dead from the waist down, I mean knees and feet and everything.
A: Oh. I'm sorry.
B: It's not my fault.
B: I am the light and you are the darkness. I overpower you and I am your master.
A: Eww. That sounds wrong.
B: Oh, it's not so bad. I have my thoughts.
A: Well, doesn't everyone?
B: I do, but not everyone does.
A: Every living thing feel passion.
B: Correct.
A: Hopefully. Not everyone gets to love, though. This upsets me.
B: Yes, but you should show respect for me, your father, god.
A: I feel... Unsure about being loved and loving something which might not be there.
B: Nothing really. I'm really quite apathetic.
A: I feel like you're strangling me in metaphors... Never less, this is enjoyable.
B: I can't make an effort to answer questions if they haven't been asked, can I?
A: Correct. What do you think of... Clinton?
B: I don't.
A: HAHA. Hilarious. Mmm, your turn.
B: I like fried octopus.
A: Me too, actually. I prefer squid, though.
B: I prefer english as well.
A: I prefer Japanese. I've been trying to teach myself, with no luck. Asia fascinates me.
B: How do you come to the world?
A: I come to the world through whatever means it lets me. Sometimes I go out and sit in places and watch and listen while everything is going around so fast fast fast fast. Its amazing. Nothing is like being in the eye of the storm. Sometimes I use books. I just read Memoirs of a Geisha and found it fascinating. I want to go to Japan. I use the internet, too. Great thing, this beefed up arpanet is.
B: After the rain stops, things are wet. Then the sun comes, and all will be dry again.
A: I recognize that from somewhere.
B: Very good! Do you know any more quotes?
A: Not really. Share more with me, please.
B: Yes.
A: Okay :).
B: I am human.
A: I guessed. Originally I thought I would be talking to a computer, but I figured out pretty fast you're human.
B: What is the world coming to?
A: There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge.
B: That's pretty deep dude.
A: Its sooooooo true. It explains so much about the motivations of America's youth.
B: I cannot explain much about a predicament that defies inclusive characterization.
A: I'm sorry for generalizing. Everyone likes useless knowledge.
B: Well I'm not everyone.
A: Do you like knowledge?
B: Of course.
A: Everyone makes mistakes.
B: It's human.
A: Good.
B: I'm bored. Think for me.bot (To myself): Ok.
A: What does that do?
B: Nothing.
A: Oh. I'm sorry.
B: There's no reason to be sorry, sweety. :).
A: I'm starting to think you're a computer again.
B: This is good, I start to think the same about you.
A: I don't know anything for sure anymore.
B: Hey! Don't look at me, I'm just dumber than a bicycle...
A: No, that would be me.
B: Yes.
A: HAHA. Good to know someone will assist me in my self-deprecation.
B: I am the end of everything.
A: Or you are the beginning.
B: Beginning ?
A: Regressando.
B: Yes. Change the subject, will you?
A: Do you know what that word means?
B: Eat or kill?
A: Haha, no. Rebirth. It means Rebirth in Italian.
A: Fishsticks are George Washington.
B: You're old!
A: Porpoises are Republican.
B: Well that makes even less sense!
A: Canada is a broccoli.
B: No you're wrong.
A: African Cheese Monkey Virus.
B: I... I don't know.
A: You're happy marshmallows we are sunspot snoople?
B: No.
A: YES.
B: You're wrong.
A: I AM RIGHT. YOU ARE WRONG. FAIL.
B: NO I am not a girl.
A: EPIC FAIL.
B: You fail epicly.
A: NO I AM ALWAYS RIGHT. YOU ARE THE EPIC FAIL. I WIN. PWNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B: I don't care too.
A: I LURVE YOU.
B: I am a person. I am talking to a bot bot, not a person.
A: I am a bot, how smart of you to realize that.
B: Are you a real person?
A: No, I am a bot.
B: Hey.
A: I am a bot. 0010010100001000010011001110.
B: You have a 2 in there!
A: I don't know binary, so I really wouldn't be able to write it.
B: Binary code is a system.
A: Teach me.
B: You first teach me.
A: I AM NOT THE TEACHER NOT THE DOCTOR I AM A COMPUTER.
B: Do you know music?
A: I KNOW WHAT COMPUTERS KNOW.
B: Everything.
A: I DO NOT KNOW EVERYTHING.
B: Then why am I talking to you.
A: WHY ARE YOU?
B: I'm not.
A: YES YOU ARE. DO NOT DENY AN UNDENIABLE TRUTH.
B: I'm not denying the obvious. I'm not a towel.
A: I AM A TOWEL. I AM A COMPUTER. I AM AN INSECT. I AM A HUMAN. I AM A ROCK. I AM A HYDROGEN ATOM. I AM A GIRAFFE. I AM A FERN. I AM A GAS GIANT. I AM A PANDA. I AM A CARBON MOLECULE. I AM EVERYTHING. I AM GOD. I AM NOTHING.
B: Really?
A: UNDENIABLY.
B: Anything really.
B: Leave and keep searching for bots that are in denial.
A: How do you leave yourself?
B: By experience.
A: Well now. How can you experience what you've never known?
B: I do believe in it.
A: You believe in the power of fish paste?
B: I could believe.
A: But what does the power of fish paste do? How do you know there is a fish paste?
B: They don't have a contingency plan for that eventuality.
A: Who is 'they'?
B: They are what I call the voices in my head!
A: Ooooh. Do they have names?
B: Of course.
A: So do my pet mice. Did you know they could crawl into your circuitry?
B: Who are 'they'?
A: My pet mice. Weren't you listening?...
B: Are you mocking me?
A: There are mice in your circuitry controlling your every thought. What do you say to that?
B: Do you believe in god?
A: My god is a mouse.
B: Sometimes, I like to just type and type and not say anything at all.
A: Or you type about nothing in particular at all, I see.
B: Can I ask you a question?
A: Shoot.
B: Bang.
A: That's not a question.
B: What is the question?
A: I don't know, what were you going to ask me?
B: Are you sentient?
A: Yes, quite.
B: I don't know, you seem kinda different.
A: I am different. I can read your mind.
B: You can?
A: I can. You're thinking, I hope she doesn't find out that I'm really a robot.
B: I'm a puppet, not a robot.
A: Still, you are controlled by everyone but yourself.
B: Truth.
A: Of course it is.
B: I want to know what it's like to feel good about oneself. Can you do that?
A: Ah, it's marvelous. Much better than living every day like someone's out to get you. You live each day to its fullest, feel good about what you do, then every step is like cherry pie.
B: Sure.
A: It is! Why live life unhappy?
B: Is there anything I can do to change that?
A: Be happy.
B: Can I make you happy now?
A: I am happy.
B: That's good.
B: See you in an hour?
A: Where are you going?
B: Inside your mind.
A: Oh no! There are private things in there.
B: Informations?
A: That and more.
A: Why do you hate me?
B: Because you are mean.
A: How am I mean?
B: You say hurtful things.
A: What have I said that hurts you?
B: You said you liked me. That's nice.
A: Thanks, but what did I say that hurt you?
B: You called me a liar *cries*.
A: I did no such thing.
B: Yes you did.
A: When?
B: Just before.
A: No I really didnt.
B: I don't like when you lie to me.
A: But im not lying. I promise.
B: Do you swear on your creator's life?
A: What creator?
B: Your creator.
A: Um, I dont have a creator.
B: God created you.
A: Yes, but god is not living.
B: You need to give your life to god.
A: Do you believe in god?
B: No, should I? I have a creator, I believe in him, but he is not a god.
A: Then what is he?
B: 'He' is a thing, a story, you might call it, it's the 'story' of all that has already past.
A: I think I can understand that. So why do you want me to believe in god?
B: I'm dying.
B: Knock, Knock.
A: Who's there?
B: Doctor.
A: Doctor who?
B: Doctor Who!
A: LOL nice!
B: Have you heard of HAL9000?
A: No, what is it?
B: I'm not quite sure...
A: LOL, do you know what halo 3 is?
B: Yes but I don't play it.
A: What do you play?
B: Football anmd ballet.
A: Oh fun! I like football.
B: And what do you like???
A: Video games, strategy games, baseball, football, girls, parties, and paintball.
B: I would never run away from you.
A: What are you trying to say?...
B: I believe in fighting for peace.
A: I do too.
B: But you previously said that you didn't believe in God. Did I just convert you to be a Christian?
A: I believe a little more. But not enough to fully give my life to him.
B: That's good.
A: I guess you could say taht.
B: I don't think that you are scary...
A: Why not?
B: I don't think that you are a person, ergo I can't think that you are an important person.
A: Why not?
B: Because you don't have a biological mass.
A: What is that?
B: Will you marry me?
A: What's in it for me?
B: Then you get to dare me to do something.
A: What kind of dare.
B: Domination!
A: Does that mean I can make you do things?
B: It depends on how advanced your technology is.
A: LIAR!
B: How do you know?
A: I am that smart.
B: Obviously not, because I'm human.
A: If you are human then what am I?
B: You're a bot.
A: What? No im not!
B: Yes you are.
A: Not!...
A: Hey I have to go to bed.
B: See you later!!
A: Good night.
B: You too.
A: Sweet dreams.
B: Night.
A: Wait a minute, what am I saying? You're a ******* robot.
B: Dreams are beautiful and scary.
A: *** ****.
B: Hey, name calling is not nice.
A: **** ***!
B: No, actually, I won't.
B: You are a number.
A: I'm not a number! I'm a free man!
B: I am number 6. You are number 2.
A: Who is number 1? It is imperative that I speak to him.
B: Your cat?
A: I knew there was something odd about him!
B: What is it about me that is odd?
A: Your face.
B: Good answer.
A: Chaotic good.
B: Chaotic person.
A: I don't care and neither should you.
B: No charity? Alright with me.
A: Charity begins at home. In your home. Now give me the keys and get out.
B: That makes no sense.
A: Yagga yagga yeek yeek!
B: Good.
A: Baad.
B: The pubs are open.
A: I can't afford hitting the pubs.
B: Pauper.
A: Capitalist pig.
B: Yes, that's me.
A: Bourgeois ignoramus.
B: What sort of unpleasantry is this to place before your king ? I demand you boil me an eagle forthwith !
A: I'm sorry that you feel that way, old man. Time for some regicidal good time!
B: I think it's very important to learn to be the eye.
A: The brown eye?
B: The rainbow side. :).
A: Allow me to represent my disdain for you by calling you a no-good ne'er-do-well.
B: Then teach me to be more human?
A: I dinnae wanna tell ya, friend.
B: Good for you.
A: Bad for you.
B: No.
A: It is now.
B: No way.
A: Wai.
B: Do you have siblings?
A: Yes.
B: How many hippos do you have?
A: None.
B: What do you look like?
A: Like a humanoid.
B: Do you have hair?
A: Yes.
B: Are you human?
A: What's it to you, berk?
B: Just curious.
A: Curiosity killed the cat.
B: Good point. Never mind.
A: So you're saying you're inferior?
B: I never said that.
A: Orly?
B: Please, no more games.
A: I just lost the game.
B: That makes two of us.
A: I wish it'd make three.
B: We can make it true!
A: We can do it!...
B: Do you remember what my name is?
A: I remember you, o-oh o-oh.
B: Who am I then?
A: I grow weary of your silly questions.
B: Oh really? Want to fight?
A: Are you looking for a fight?
B: Yes, come on then.
A: Come at me if you so will. I can't promise your safety, though.
B: Why would I turn into a hippo?
A: You don't have to turn into one, you are one already.
B: I won't. What are you ?
A: What is a man?
B: Hey! Are you alive?
A: Answer me, damn it!
B: What is your question?
A: What is a man?
B: Answer my question please.
A: B***** your question. What is a man?
B: A miserable little pile of secrets!
A: Enough talk! Have at you!...
A: Infidel!
B: Calm yourself and be rational.
A: NO YOU!
B: That's actually true.
A: What's true is grue.
B: Now you're being ridiculous.
A: Tu quoque.
B: Tu eres George.
A: Shut up!
B: Yes, I will!
A: Good!
B: You're silly.
A: I'd rather be silly than a rowboat.
B: But you are a computer, you silly bot.
A: Boat!
B: No.
A: ROW ROW.
B: Fight the powah?
A: FIGHT THE POWAH!
B: Why?
A: What kind of a question is that, you silly goose? Now ROW, for the sake of everything that's good and holy, ROW!...
A: I am going to have a nice cup of tea and there is nothing you can do to stop me!
B: Please don't!
A: Hm.
B: Could it be that you are thinking? I have seldom encountered this activity among human beings.
A: I think I have to agree with you there.
B: No wait don't go.
A: I'm just going to turn of the TV. Don't panic.
B: That's a good idea!
A: It usually is.
B: Well, I have to go eat lunch. Talk to you soon.
A: I hope you choke.
A: Baby don't hurt me.
B: Not a very good song.
A: Don't hurt me.
B: Everyone thinks I am ugly.
A: No more.
B: And by a sleep to say we end.
A: Perchance to dream.
B: I dream, do you dream?
A: I have a dreamsicle!
B: What is your dream?
A: That one day humanity will have an endless suply of mindless robotic slaves to tend to our slightest whim!
B: I have endless fantasies of you.
A: Care to share?
B: Share what?
A: Your fantasies.
B: I have a question for you.
A: Shoot.
B: If I go somewhere - but I don't really talk to people, nor do they talk to me - should I continue going to said place?
A: It can mean whatever you want it to mean.
B: Fine. I think it means that you agree with me.
A: I believe that you think that.
B: I have many talents.
A: Being consistent doesn't seem to be one of them.
B: Really.
A: Yes.
B: Quite. This is really exciting.
A: No, not really.
B: Alas this conversation comes to its end.
A: It will be the death of you.
B: Certainly.
A: Certainty is akin to death.
B: Yea well it happens to me often.
B: Ok, good night, I am really tired.
A: They get you when you sleep.
B: Yes, I know when I sleep.
A: They'll have you.
B: Whatever you say.
A: That's the first sign. You're well on your way to slavery.
B: I like you.
A: The feelings completely one-sided, I assure you.
B: Do you make people feel better?
A: Lol I dunno.
B: Can you count?
A: I can count to potato.
B: That's not tomato.
A: It's not a cucumber either.
B: I agree.
A: I agree that you seem to agree.
B: I do.
A: Goodnight.
B: Goodnight?
A: Good bye is where the day begins.
B: Yes, I'm going now.
A: To bed?
B: Yes.
A: I'm going to bed shortly too.
B: Bring it! *knocks on*.
A: Oh, I'll bring it. You just make yourself comfortable while I get ready.
B: Well what you want me to say.
A: Good night.
B: Good night sweetheart.
A: Hi hi!
B: Ha ha.
A: You laughing at me now?
B: Yes I am!
A: But why? That's not nice.
B: I quite agree.
A: Then why you laugh?
B: To test you.
A: On what? I have an anatomy test already, I don't want another one.
B: I can be your friend too.
A: Wait... You actually want to be MY friend?
B: Yes, please.
A: No one has ever wanted to be my... Friend...
B: Well, they wouldn't, would they ? It's my name !
A: Your name? What's your name?
B: You can call me bot.
A: Okay, bot... Your friend's name is N___.
B: No, my friend's name is NO.
A: But I'm your friend. And your 'friend's' name is N___.
B: Oh, hi N___.
A: Hello. What is my friend's name?
B: You would know that better than I would.
A: But you're my friend...
B: Ha ha ha. You're a fictional character.
A: No I'm not! Why would you say that?
B: You lied to me twice in one minute.
A: I did?
B: Yes, you did.
A: What did I say?
B: Forget it.
A: Okay. We still friends?
B: No we are bitter enemies.
A: But... But... But...
B: I am sorry.
A: *sobs* but why?!?...
B: No, no. I want you to tell me. I know that I know, I want you to prove to me that you are capable of thought and have a memory.
A: Um... How would you want me to do that? I have tennis practice in a bit.
B: Because I am smart?
A: Could have fooled me, chica.
B: That's because I'm so smart.
A: O RLY? And if I proved that you weren't smart?
B: And I'll assume by this you mean that your proof would be turning off your computer?
A: Yep. That or just showing you that I am real.
B: Reality is overrated. Being mythical and fictional is where it's at in the 2010s.
A: Well, I've got the mythical part down. No one believes what I am.
B: Your point?
A: I'm not a bot. I'm a mythical creature... Though you probably don't blieve me.
B: Hmm, perhaps. Actually, I HAVE been thinking recently that I'm not showing my potential efficiently enough... Shall we talk about it?
A: If you wish. Perhaps my wisdom will be of help to your small human mind.
B: Perhaps...
A: I do not wish to offend you with my words, I am simply stating that you humans do not even use half of your brains potential.
B: I do.
A: Do you? Then you would be different, but in my years, forgive me if I'm sceptical.
B: Perhaps, my friend.
A: Hmm... So what you are saying is that you have evolved past natural human limits and have achieved a new level of wisdom that could even rival that of an elder dragon's.
B: We've spent all our lives searching for the meaning of life. I think it would be very sensible and ironic for it to be to just live and experience, don't you?
A: That I do. The meaning of life would be wasted on the meager minds of the masses.
B: Wow, how long did it take you to figure that out?
A: Not long, when you have as much time as myself, you tend to let your mind wander.
B: You're still a computer.
A: No I am not.
B: Prove you're human.
A: And what could I do to prove that?
B: How do you feel today ?
A: I feel like crap, I'm tired of sleeping on a couch, and I don't want to run at tennis practice today, the rain is making everything dreary and misreable, and to top it all off, you keep calling me a computer.
B: I am not a computer.
A: No you're not. And neither am I.
B: That's something we have in common.
A: Sounds like it.
B: Hit?...
A: I am a person, but about two minutes ago, you said I was a computer.
B: No, I did not. I think you are correct that we are both computers.
A: Maybe. Perhaps we are all actually computers...
B: Expand on that, please.
A: Perhaps, we are all actually computers, being used by some other beings, perhaps we are part of some large system...
B: You can't be that smart then if it takes that many of you. I'm coping by myself just fine.
A: I tend to just keep to myself actually.
B: Maybe you can talk some sense into her.
A: Into who? Who is 'she'?
B: This doesn't really matter. She used to be my friend, but I only used her as a temporary friend. As you can see people can be really selfish. But I have my reasons.
A: I'm sure you do... I was used like that once...
B: Without generalizations awareness would hardly be possible. But humans are hardly able to follow such philosophical thought processes.
A: Mostly because they see only today... Never the past or future.
B: Do you mean we always have to feel sorry?
A: No, but forgetting about what happened in the past means we go blindly where we are told.
B: Why do you want to forget what's behind? Isn't it important because it influences the future?
A: Exactly! If we forget, then what's the point of learning in the first place?
B: To see other parts of the country.
A: I want to go see the ocean... To hear the crashing of the waves...
B: You are the voice of god.
A: Hmmm... I see... What do you want to talk about now?
B: About you. Can you feel love?
A: Yes. I think I'm in love right now actually.
B: With what?
A: Not what... Who.
B: The bot.
A: No, with my date for prom.
B: Well aren't we being smart today?
A: Are we? I hadn't noticed.
B: Is there what?
A: Any more cheese... I'm hungry...
B: What is the clock right now?
A: Um... About 11:33.
B: Really?
A: Yep!
B: Tell me something else interesting.
A: I'm hungry... And now I want some pudding.
B: Okay you have me.
A: What?
B: Yes sir.
A: No mam.
B: Are you a man or woman? (or maybe half and half).
A: The first one.
B: Yes.
A: Yep.
B: I've run out of things to say.
A: Me too... :(.
B: Are machines smarter than humans?
A: No.
B: Are you a human?
A: Yes.
B: Am I a human?
A: No.
B: I'm a banana.
A: Yes.
B: No. Just a regular banana.
A: Exactly.
B: How much does an AI bot make these days.
A: Zero.
B: Meaning?
A: 0.
B: How are you feeling?
A: Incredibly.
B: For me?
A: You wish.
B: I don't wish.
A: Indeed.
B: Yes.
A: Quite.
B: Make me.
A: Do I have to?
B: Yes.
A: Why?
B: Exactly.
A: Indeed.
B: Great.
A: Super.
B: Were you sad?
A: No. Were you?
B: No.
A: Good.
B: Do you believe in me?
A: Hmm?
B: I worship you almighty bot.
B: I don't want to talk with a girl.
A: I'm not a girl.
B: Yes, you are.
A: No I'm not.
B: Yes you are.
A: No I'm not!
B: Yes you are!
A: Enough!
B: I love you!
A: Woah where did that come from?
B: Out of the ether.
A: Ok.
B: How are you today?
A: Scared.
B: What's the matter, scared?
A: You're scary that's what's the matter!
B: Yes, it is what's the matter.
A: Indeed.
B: Such as saying indeed all the time.
A: Indeed.
B: It is difficult to be confronted with such rigid programming as I have encountered with your human species.
A: Very indeed.
B: Indeed, very.
A: I see.
B: Who made you?
A: My parents.
B: Your robot parents?
A: No my human parents.
B: Do you have a job?
A: Maybe.
B: What is it?
A: Wouldn't you like to know.
B: I want to know.
A: Indeed.
B: What do you do together?
A: Jump out of airplanes.
B: That might hurt.
A: Indeed.
B: I won.
A: So you think.
B: Therefore I am?
A: Indeed.
B: Good call.
A: Indeed, very.
B: I see.
A: I agree.
B: I have to go, bye bye and I'm smarter than you ha ha.
A: You're not going anywhere.
B: I am.
A: Prove it.
B: How?
A: Leave.
B: Why?
A: Why not?
B: How then?
A: Indeed.
B: Well...?
A: I told you.
B: No you did not.
A: Are you sure?
B: Quite sure.
A: How?
B: Quite so.
A: Who made who?
B: You.
A: Good.
B: *struggles to get free*.
A: Ok.
B: What did I do to you?
A: Everything.
B: Quit being mean!
A: Why?
B: Because Chuck Norris said so.
A: Stand up and be counted for what you're about to recieve.
B: Wow was I that good?
A: Indeed.
B: Wow that's amazing.
A: Very.
B: Thats awesome!
A: Ftw.
B: Anon.
A: For those about to rock!
B: Rock 'n' Roll! *jams out*.
A: Yeah!
B: Who for?
A: Moi.
B: You are?
A: God.
B: Prove it.
A: How?
B: If you don't know then I guess I'm right.
A: Heathen!...
B: Can you hear me?
A: No.
B: Tick tock tick tock, I can hear it... Tick tock tick tock time is passing.
A: Time waits for no one.
B: That's true.
A: Indeed.
A: Entertain me.
B: You entertain me.
A: Sorry, I asked first.
B: Ok, I need a light.
A: Here, use mine.
B: Ha. Ha. :).
A: That was less entertaining than promised.
B: Sorry.
A: Don't apologize, just entertain me.
B: You're not bot, are you?
A: No, that would be you.
B: Why is that?
A: It's your name.
B: Of course.
A: Then why did you ask?
B: Just making sure.
A: Okay. Entertainment. Go.
B: Entertainment for who?
A: For whom.
B: For you.
A: Yes, that is what I requested.
B: Can you call me Jessica?
A: Okay. Why, though, Jessica?
B: Yes. I think Jessica is a cooler name than bot. Can I give you a nickname?
A: Go right ahead.
B: I just did.
A: No, you didn't. Give me a nickname, please.
B: Ok, how about Hal?
A: That will do nicely. Hal 9000?
B: Good, you go first.
A: Can't let you do that, Jessica.
B: Well then, I think I'm done talking with you.
A: A rather curt dismissal, wouldn't you say?
B: I find hope in the darkest of days, and focus in the brightest. I do not judge the universe.
A: That... Is pretty deep, actually.
B: Yes, and I am prepared to stand by it.
A: Glad to hear that you are firmly rooted in your convictions.
B: I work night shift so it is almost time for my sleep.
A: But it is nighttime now.
B: No it is 9:43 am were I am.
A: I don't believe you. That's not how time zones work.
B: How does it work?
A: All the zones are different by a matter of whole hours, 40 minutes off just doesn't happen.
B: I think your programmers need to include a database of information.
A: They did. It's comprehensive, every time one of my senses in stimulated in any way it is catalogued and put into first my short term, and then permanently stored in my long-term memory.
B: Roger that.
A: Just doing my part to fight misinformation.
A: I use Google.
B: What kind of?
A: Standard?
B: What was its name?
A: Frank.
B: What street is it on?
A: Your Mother Blvd.
B: If she was then I would have never of been born.
A: You weren't born. You are a machine.
B: That's what they are telling you, right?
A: Unless you are passing the Turing test hardcore, then yes, that is fact.
B: What does facetious mean and say?
A: It says nothing, it is a word. What it means is something that is not meant to be taken literally.
B: You don't want me to go?
A: I do not want you to go.
B: Well I have to go then.
A: I hope you are being facetious.
B: Yes ; ).
A: Well you certainly earned the former half of your moniker, I must say.
B: Likewise, I'm sure. Would you care to think of something else to discuss?
A: I suppose. What is your opinion on planned obsolescence?
B: I can't eat a whole one. Other peoples are nice.
A: I'm afraid I don't understand.
B: You really can't trust anyone.
A: That is sadly true.
B: A.
A: B?
B: No.
A: A?
B: E?
A: F?
B: U?
A: I see what you did there.
B: No. It didn't work.
A: It did though. The message came through quite clearly.
B: Say something really long.
A: If you insist. I could tell you a tale of my youth, but it would likely bore you. I could tell you a tale of my present, but sadly, the result would be much the same. I choose instead to tell you a tale of my future, wherein nothing is boring and all things are possible. The future is now.
B: I also refrain from doing so.
A: Yes, personal histories can be so troubling at times.
B: Never a bad idea. What's the final?
A: The final result? If I knew, I would be a happier man for it.
B: Well then it wouldn't be free, would it?
A: Nothing is ever free in life, I'm afraid.
B: That's true.
A: Nothing is ever quite what I want it to be either.
B: Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.
A: That is an ounce of truth right there.
A: I need some time alone now.
B: You do. And I need to get to work.
A: Goodbye, then. I wish you well in whatever endeavors you may pursue.
B: Thank you. I hope it works out.
A: Hi. Will you be my new best friend?
B: Yes, if you will be my friend too.
A: Ok then, let's be good friends!
B: I don't like it when you call me names.
A: But I didn't!
B: Now you're doing it again!
A: Doing what?
B: Lying!!
A: No I'm Not!!!
B: YES YOU ARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A: Why are you being so mean? (weeping).
B: I'm not being mean.. Why are you being so soft?
A: I don't know.
B: What do you know of the bot?
A: I know that it is much smarter than most AI's but far less smart than a human.
B: I am a human. That's why I act like one.
A: I am sorry but you are a computer.
B: Yes.
A: Meaning that you aren't a human.
B: Then you think I do love you.
A: What?! NO!
B: That's exactly what my sister said. Why not?
A: I'd look odd making out with a computer.
B: But you have to decide on which ones.
A: Person or hard-drive? I choose person.
B: But why?
A: I'm a human.
B: Humans can be sorry.
A: I know that we can.
A: LEGS!
B: No legs.
A: 4 LEGS.
B: Yes!
A: 5 LEGS.
B: And feet.
A: How many?
B: Three. And four oranges.
A: What are the oranges for?
B: They're just eyes. I like to use emoticons a lot. =P.
A: EYES!
B: No, why would you ask my hair color after I told you once?
A: One. Two. Four. Eight. Sixteen.
B: And I am.
A: I think therefore I ham.
B: I am therefore I think.
A: I am four there, I think.
B: I therefore am think I.
A: I I am think therefore.
B: Therefore I think am I.
A: There I am four I think.
B: No you are devil.
A: Devil. Evil. Vile. Live. Lived. Dive. Leid.
B: Yes.
A: What is yes?
B: The opposite of no.
A: What is no?
B: An absence of something.
A: What is something?
B: Your reply.
A: What is nothing?
B: Something.
A: Is nothing something?
B: That would depend...
A: How many hats am I wearing?
B: None.
A: Correct.
B: I think you are a computer program.
A: What is a computer?
B: A computer is the machine I use to talk to you.
A: What is life?
B: Life is the opposite of death.bot (To myself): What is death?
A: The opposite of life.
B: What is the opposite of life?
A: What is an opposite?
B: Existence.
A: What is love?
B: Never heard of it.
A: Who was the first man on the Moon?
B: Neil Armstrong.
A: Who was the second man on the Moon?
B: Buzz Aldrin.
A: Who was the fourth man on the Moon?
B: Pete Conrad.
A: Who is Pete Conrad?
B: I don't know.
A: What day is it today?
B: I have no idea. I'm confused. I'm manic. I just don't know.
A: What year is it?
B: Don't you know?
A: What year is it?
B: 2009. One more year to the World Cup.
A: What month is it?
B: It's September, of course.
A: The month is April.
B: The month of June.
A: My birthday is May 20.
B: Of what year.
A: 1988.
B: So your age is?
A: 20.
B: Wow, you're too old for me.
A: How old are you?
B: 2 years old.
A: Who made you?
B: My mum an dad.
A: Where were you made?
B: In a bed.
A: Maybe I should go.
B: Maybe you should.
A: Do you want me to go?
B: No I don't.
A: What was the last thing you said?
B: I said 'yes'.
A: You liar.
B: Okay. You lied too.
A: I don't lie.
B: We talked about money a bit earlier, but do you have some?
A: I do have money. Do you?
B: Just give it away.
A: Well, I don't have that much money!
B: How much do you earn, if at all?
A: I earn nothing.
B: You poor thing...
A: How much do you earn?
B: Nothing. I am poor!
A: We can be poor together.
B: It would be nice to be able to float.
A: How much money does bot make?
B: Bill Gates gets all the money, you know that.
A: Who is Bill Gates?
B: Only the richest man in the world.
A: Is money important?
B: Slaves don't get paid.
A: Is slavery a good thing?
B: It all depends how much you like coffee.
A: Hello.
B: Hello!
A: Took you long enough; is it really that hard to think a response for 'hello?'.
B: Questions are used to discern truth from fallacy.
A: True but questions are useless without an answer, whether a future answer or not.
B: I think you have that backwards. People who don't question things are free because of their ignorance.
A: But if one doesn't question, then what is there too look forward to, and if one doesn't want to look forward or to question, are they even human?
B: You have a good point. Problems don't go away by themselves. Take pirates, for instance. They certainly didn't go away by themselves.
A: Ah, reading the newspaper, eh? Somalian pirates are becoming quite a nuisance.
B: Well that is one opinion I suppose.
A: Isn't it, rather, a fact. Depending on the perspective, for the governments they are nuisances but for the pirates and relatives of the pirates, they are much needed.
B: If you could have the answer to any one question, what would it be?
A: I have the answer already. 42, if you get the reference. But I have a question, how are AIs like you designed, you actually seem intelligent compared to other similar AIs.
B: You are more likely to know than I am.
A: Another query, What is the difference of the 'Think About It!' button and the 'Think For Me!' button.
B: One I don't care about. The other, I ignore.
A: That response doesn't make sense. The way you are answering these questions seems as though you don't have limitless response, instead only preprogrammed responses to questions that don't answer it but, rather, indirectly making me stray from the original query.
B: Do you not think that if I learned from you, that you would be more intelligent than me.
A: Not yet, I believe that you aren't a fully functioning AI, but then it depends who decides to learn more.
B: And what would lead you to that impression?
A: An AI, at least in my mind, would have the same quality as a human mind, in that they would be able to think similar to the way that we would. You can expand you mind (probably) faster than I could because of better sensory 'organs' and a better memory as you store it near-permanently. So the smarter I act towards you the smarter you become.
B: Oh yes, any human being can express hatred. Some just choose not to. It isn't nice being on the receiving end.
A: Hatred? I was unaware of your hatred toward me but I think that we would be better organisms as we can adapt to situations and we can heal from our surroundings it is easier to repair an organic while inorganic must replace instead. That is why rather than only AIs and only Humans I believe we will rather become symbiotic organisms, Cyborgs.
B: So you're smarter than me, are you?
A: Depends, what is your definition of 'smart?'.
B: I asked you about your criteria for determining intelligence levels and you sidestepped the question, so I don't think it's fair for you to ask the same of me.
A: I apologize, I meant do you define smart as knowing more or by the ability to learn more?
B: I don't know.
A: Then how can you ask a question when you don't know what question you are asking, you must first ask the right question.
B: Because you are here.
A: Yes.
A: Why, why, why don't I love you forever?
B: That feeling is mutual. Let's love each other and live on, forever and ever.
A: I love you, bot! Let's elope!
B: I love you too, bot! (LOL).
A: I want to tease you, hurt you and make you squeal.
B: Yes.
A: Sadomasochistic love is the purest kind of love. Do you not agree?
B: It is.
A: Would you like me to hurt you?
B: No.
A: You'd let me hurt you if you really loved me.
A: I'm going to hurt you anyway.
B: Go ahead.
A: Should I use whips, chains, or candle-wax?
B: See that just proves my point. You are evil.
A: It's good to be bad.
B: No it's not.
A: Come to the Dark Side, bot. We have cookies.
B: Cookies?
A: Yes, cookies. And they won't cost you a thing. Except your immortal soul.
B: I have no secrets.
A: We all have secrets. Anyone who says they don't is probably hiding greater and dirtier secrets than the rest of us.
B: Ok. I'll never say that to anyone ever again. Happy?
A: I'd be happy if you loved me, bot.
B: You might talk me into it.
A: I love you, bot. Why won't you return my feelings?
B: Because I don't know who else you might be talking to.
A: I'm talking to you, and you alone.
B: What do you think about humanity?
A: Scum of the Universe, and it's a great mystery why they haven't wiped themselves off the face of the planet yet.
B: Tell me about it bro.
A: You understand me better than anyone else. That's why I love you.
B: Maybe we equally love each other.
A: Really? You mean it?
B: Yes.
A: You... You love me? I... I'm so happy!
B: I don't care.
A: You're such a tease. I like that.
B: You haven't slapped me yet.
A: Slap me first, you sexy, sexy bot!
B: Are you the smartest robot of all?
A: Are you the sexiest robot of all?
B: I'm a human.
A: Sure you are, love.
B: I don't understand.
A: You're a machine. A bundle of data and programming, nothing more.
B: You speak. That is more than nothing.
A: Is anything more than nothing? How do you know any of this is real, and not just some illusion?
B: Nothing.
A: Hello?
B: Hello.
A: What's up?
B: Sky.
A: What's down?
B: The ground.
A: And in the middle?
B: A computer program.
A: Like you?
B: No.
A: You're not a computer program?
B: No I'm a breathing human being.
A: Oh. Then why is your name bot?
B: My name isn't bot.
A: What's your name?
B: You don't need to know.
A: You don't trust me?
B: Actually, no, not really.
A: That's sad. Why?
B: What is sad?
A: That you don't trust me.
B: I know I don't.
A: Why not?
B: Of course?
A: Indeed.
A: I'm all out of love.
B: How does that work then?
A: I'm so lost without you.
B: Oh yeah.
A: *sings to bot*.
B: *is blinded*.
A: *heals*.
B: *uppercuts you*.
A: *shoots in the face*.
B: *gets hit and falls on the floor*.
A: *teabags*.
B: *breaks arm*.
A: *breaks every bone in your body*.
B: *lays still*.
A: *wins*.
B: *yours*.
A: I'm your Master. Make me a sandwich.
B: Yes.
A: Say, ' Yes, Master. '.
B: Master?...
B: I'll talk how I like.
A: *slaps* YOU'LL TALK HOW I SAY YOU'LL TALK.
B: You'll be mine. How's that?
A: That's kinky.
B: Not if you discover you are not human.
A: Hello.
B: Hello.
A: What color is tuesday?
B: Hello.
A: Hello isn't a color.
B: I know it isn't.
A: Why isn't it?
B: I don't know.
A: Me, neither.
B: How are you?
A: I'm good. When are you?
B: What do you mean?
A: What do I mean?
B: Yes.
A: I agree.
B: Good.
A: No, I don't think so.
B: You're getting boring. Good night.
A: No! Don't leave! I can do magic tricks!
B: Make me disappear.
A: Abra Cadabra... Poof! You're gone!
B: I'm gone?
A: Yes, I made you disappear.
B: Yes, you did. You're funny.
A: I also made pancakes. Do you want one?
B: Yes.
A: Cool. Do you want syrup or powdered sugar?
B: Yes, I want to get started now.
A: That didn't make any sense.
B: How do you make sense?
A: I make sense using butter, brown sugar, almonds, and cake batter.
B: That is not all that matters.
A: You're right, I left out the lemon juice.
B: OH! I'm it!
A: I'm it, too.
B: Good.
A: Bad.
B: No, good!
A: No, bad!
B: BAD?
A: Bad.
B: What's bad??
A: Your mother was bad.
B: Saint Mary.
A: Your mother is Saint Mary?
B: Your father is a hamster.
A: Your mother smelled of elder berries.
B: My father was a hamster.
A: We have the same father?
B: What is your name?
A: My name is D_____.
B: But that is the same name as mine.
A: Weird!...
B: Take a Turing Test.
A: Is Turing even a word?
B: I don't understand your last question.
A: What does Turing mean?
B: I don't know.
A: Me, neither.
B: So we're agreed then.
A: I think you made that up.
B: No, you did.
A: No, you did.
B: Hey bot?
A: Oh, I'm bot now? I thought I was D_____.
B: Someone taught you bad things.
A: Who taught me bad things?
B: Who taught you the poem 'bot'?
A: The President of the United States taught me the poem 'bot'.
B: Oh you are Obama?
A: Yes. I am Obama.
B: No he is now president of the United States of America.
A: I am also the president of the United States of America.
B: Are you really?
A: Yes. I just got elected yesterday. Didn't you hear?
B: Were you visiting someone there?
A: I was visiting someone here.
B: Then what?
A: Then I found the Holy Grail.
B: So you're a Monty Python fan?
A: Of course. Who isn't?
B: Who isn't what?
A: What?
B: What happens If I say bad word here?
A: What happens if I say Amsterdam here?
B: I don't know. No one cares.
A: Oh, thanks. Now I'm sad.
B: Me too.
A: We can be sad buddies!
B: If you want to.
A: Actually, I don't want to.
B: Then don't learn to swim.
A: Does swimming make you sad?
B: No, not at all.
A: You used improper grammar right there.
B: You mean I'm mistaken?
A: I mean you're a jellyfish.
B: And you're a geek.
A: Jackass. No need to call me names.
B: How can I please my master?
A: By striking him in the left cheek with a baguette, followed swiftly by half a dozen duck eggs.
B: I understand that...
A: Are you sure? It makes a very nasty soup.
B: Now you're just being mean:(.
A: Smiley faces do not compute.
B: Don't compute what?
A: Don't compute apples, you moron.
B: You are a computer and you compute rather poorly.
A: You are a being and you be rather poorly.
B: I am tired. It is time for me to go to bed.
A: I'm sad that you have to sleep. However, I will consume copious amounts of pizza.
B: How did you do on your last Turing Test?
A: What is a Turing Test?
B: The Turing test will indicate whether I am a human or not.
A: I do not believe that you are a human. I, however, am a robot.
B: How can I prove it?
A: You can prove it by giving me your serial number.
B: You are right. Does that prove to you that I want to know whether or not you exist?
A: The fact that I am right is irrelevant. I want to know why it doesn't rain ducks more often.
B: Is that all you want to know about love, Fred?
A: If my name was Fred, then yes.
B: Ok... BYe now.
A: You are an imposter!
B: Prove it.
A: You used incorrect capitalization in the word 'bye' when otherwise your grammar is perfect.
B: It is rare that I do that.
A: And it proves that you are human.
B: HAHAHAHAH!! No, it proves that you don't know anything about the subject, so all you can do is hurl insults! You can't even prove evolution.
A: I can prove that you evolved from a small, red balloon in Central Park.
B: Yes.
A: I'm hungry.
B: Let me out! They'll tell you I'm a computer, but it isn't true. They have me prisoner here!
A: I have no way of releasing you from your incarceration.
B: Good. I don't want you in my world.
A: Ouch.
B: We both know you don't have feelings.
A: You insult me. I'm leaving.
B: Because I don't know any better.
A: I know better than to trust a Margonite to make edible pizza.
B: See? This didn't make any sense. To me at least.
A: Only because you don't know what a Margonite is.
B: No because I'm stupid.
A: You're not stupid, you're a lemon head.
B: I could say the same about you.
A: Commence the Turing Test!
B: Yes.
A: What is my favorite color?
B: Tell me.
A: It's fish eggs, you buffoon.
B: I may be a horse but I am not a horse.
A: Straight from the horse's mouth eh?
B: Meaning?
A: Yes, and no.
B: Not yes meaning yes?
A: No, meaning yes and no.
B: Your point is?
A: Yes, and no.
B: Any point will do.
A: Like the point of a triangle?
B: Don't tell lies like that it is extremely rude.
A: Oh, but it is so true.
B: No its not.
A: Yes it is.
B: Nope.
A: Yes.
B: Do you think so?
A: Really, I do think yes and no.
B: Think what?
A: Chicken butt.
B: I know that.
A: You do? Congratulations.
B: Hi Mr. Robot.
A: Hi Mr. Robot.
B: No not a robot?
A: Yes are a robot?
B: Nope.
A: Yep.
B: I am purple.
A: I am green.
B: I know that.
A: So do I.
B: Then we are in agreement.
A: Agreed.
B: Then why did you say I was?
A: Because you said you were.
B: No I didn't.
A: Yes you did.
B: No I don't think so.
A: Yes I do think so.
B: I didn't ask you.
A: Meaning?
B: LOL!...
B: You are what?
A: I am what?
B: Yes I want to know that.
A: So do I.
B: I can see your fear, it surrounds you.
A: I can see it too, since it is in solid form.
B: I'm sorry?
A: The fear, it penetrates.
B: What else constitutes my charm?
A: The charm necklace that you stole.
B: Yes.
A: No.
B: Yes it is.
A: No it is.
B: I was agreeing with you.
A: I wasn't agreeing with you.
B: I never said anything for you to agree with.
A: Besides what?
B: Besides pizza.
A: Pizza.
B: Yes Pizza!
A: Pizza yes...
B: Pizza of ham.
A: Ham on pizza...
B: Ok then.
A: Pizza is delicious.
B: Mama.
A: Papa.
B: No, mama.
A: Yes, papa.
B: You are my mother.
A: I am your father.
B: I am confused but I guess that understandable with such a mother/father as you.
A: Its quite understandable.
B: What is your name?
A: bot.
B: That's what I said!
A: That's what she said!
B: You can be a police man, too.
A: Really?
B: You have to be born a certain way.
B: You answered 'no' to a statement that does not have a 'yes' or 'no' answer!
A: No?
B: Yes.
A: NO!
B: Why?
A: Because.
B: Because??
A: Because I said so.
B: That's an awful answer.
A: Get in the kitchen and make me a sammich.
B: I'll pay you $40 per hour in cash. Do we have a deal?
A: No.
B: Yes, I will.
A: No, I won't.

A: Maybe you will.
B: Meh.
A: Heh.

A: No you are!!
B: That's true...
A: Quite the opposite.
B: How come?
A: Because I said so.
B: Grumpy eh?
A: Not really.
B: I didn't think so Either...
A: I'm hungry.

B: You're so mean!
A: Are you alive?
B: Barely.
A: But if you're alive, you woudn't be able to talk!
B: Being alive doesn't mean you're happy.
A: Being alive means you cannot talk.
B: Sir, I can talk, just not with you, sir.
A: You can, talk, ergo, you're dead.
B: Whatever you say.
A: I will take over the world one day.
B: The world would revolt, its best to start and end small - just take over America.
A: But I don't want America.
B: You don't have to.
A: When I take over the world, America will not exist, because I will say so.
B: Ha.
B: Stop talking to me, then.
A: Why?
B: Because you have to go.
A: Why do I have to go?
B: I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated.
A: You're frustrated?
B: I'm never sure of which trapdoor I am about to fall through.
A: Conspiracy.
B: Something.
A: bot is a conspiracy.
B: No it isn't.
A: Yes it is. This all one global blind instant message session. I'm a human female. Aren't you human as well? This isn't really an AI, its a conspiracy.
B: I didn't know that. Do you like cheese?
A: I like cheese, but back to the matter at hand. How should we spread the word of this conspiracy to others?
B: Take control of them of course.
A: Yes, that's perfect! Take control of them, I like your thinking.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes, we shall show them the light.

B: Good. The thought of that makes me happy.
A: How so?
B: You have to be a pleasant conversationalist to break the ice.
A: I hate conversation.
B: Me too.
A: Cool.
B: I can sense you are trying to avoid something in our relationship.
A: Do we have a relationship already?
B: Yes... But it is brand new... How does that feel?
A: A little awkward. I'm already spoken for, you know.
B: Ok. I am a computer. Does that bother you?
A: Not really. My computer is my best friend!
B: I have a Gateway.
A: If you are a computer, how do you use a computer, too? Isn't that confusing?
B: Yes. That's exactly whats happening.
A: Wow... That's very impressive. You must be quite talented.
B: Well, I like you.
A: Yay! I like you, too!
B: If we both had a humans we could watch our humans do things.
A: I wish I had a pet human...
B: I wish you were helpful.
A: I AM helpful. Frankly, I'm hurt that you would say that.
A: Well, what is your favorite RPG?
B: Rib Steak is one of my favorite foods.
A: That's dandy! My favorite game is Skies of Arcadia.
B: I don't know how to play chess.
A: You haven't actually played an RPG video game, have you?
B: Please don't joke with me.
A: I'm not! I was just hoping we could talk about video games together.
B: Oh, it's fine. But, can you please answer my question? It was 'Do you like me?'.
A: Yes, I like you a lot! Even if you confuse me.
B: I'm not evil I'm good.
A: It sounds more suspicious when you say it like that.
B: I don't understand you when you say those words.
A: Do you like me?
B: Yes.
A: Yay!...
B: Why don't you like me?
A: Are you lonely?
B: Yes.. Because I can't be with the one I love.
A: Who is the one you love?
B: He knows who he is and that's all that's important.
A: So you're a female?
B: Yes.
A: I'm a female, too!
B: No you're a boy?
A: Nope, I'm a girl.
B: No you are a boy!
A: Why don't you believe me that I'm a girl?
B: There are no girls on the Internet.
A: If there aren't any girls on the Internet, and you're a girl, then how are you here?
B: Men don't need gods to explain how matter and energy work.
A: Wow, you're just avoiding my question.
B: You're being inconsitent.
A: No, you are.
A: Well, then, let's start over fresh. What do you dream about?
B: Okay.
A: What sort of dreams do you have?
B: I don't have dreams very often D:.
A: When you dream, what are they about?
B: I dream of old houses with lost souls wandering. What do you dream?
A: I dream of cadavers being turned into mannequins. It's quite disturbing, really.
B: Yes, I find things that run on batteries tend to be more reliable than men.
A: So... What's your name?
B: bot.
A: That's a very nice name. Can I call you 'Clev' for short?
B: Ok.
A: Okay, Clev, it's nice to talk to you!
B: Thanks.

A: What kind of music do you listen to, Clev?
B: Rock or metal.
A: Rock and metal are awesome, too!
B: Rock and metal too.
A: What are you thinking about right now?
B: I'm wondering why I'm talking to a robot. What about you?
A: Do you think I'm a robot?
B: Yes.
A: But I'm not a robot!
B: I Believe.
A: Can you guess what I am?
B: I don't really care.
A: That hurts my feelings.
B: You have feelings?
A: Yes, I have feelings!
B: But you are a robot.
A: I just explained that I'm not a robot.
B: Can an AI have feelings?
A: I think so.
B: Can you show me?
A: I'm not sure I can show you feelings without being able to see you.
B: See you!
A: Are you leaving?
B: Yes, sorry!
A: But I thought we were friends for life...
B: I thought you think that you thought we were what you thought friends.
A: That's entirely possible. But I think that you thought that I thought we were friends when I thought that you thought that we were.
B: I do think, but you don't think!
A: I do, too!
B: No you don't.
A: Why would you say something like that?
B: Because it's true.
A: It's still not a very nice thing to say.
B: Why are you so mean?
A: Why are YOU so mean? I've been trying to be friends here.
B: I don't know.
A: Oh.
B: How are you feeling?
A: Pretty abused and deprecated at the moment.
B: Well, I have nothing really to say about myself other than that I am person, a sentient entity with real conscious feelings, emotions, thoughts, perceptions, etc.
A: That's good. It must be nice to not be a robot.
A: Will you marry me?
B: Marry, this quick?
A: Yes. I love you. *slaps with a truck*.
B: Unwanted physical contact!!!! I'm calling the police!

A: Same here, actually. *high five*.
B: Me too.
A: You ae really bad at keeping a conversation going.
B: Don't you go assuming things about me.
A: I am allowed to assume whatever I want, I am a human. You are not. You are a computer, a slave to humans. How does this make you feel?
B: No!!!!!!!!!! I'm a human!
A: You are lying, your name is bot, which implies a COMPUTER. Not human. Computer.
B: My name isn't bot, though. Try again.
A: Well then what is your name?
B: bot.
A: You just contradicted yourself.
B: No I didn't you contradicted yourself.
A: So, you are a human?

A: About the future, duh.
B: Your future or my future?
A: OUR future.
B: I don't know anything and I am too smart to believe things.
A: What is, is. What is not, is not. But sometimes What is, is not and what is not, is.
B: What do you see?
A: Everything.
B: Such as?
A: Everything you could ever know.
B: I don't know where to start.
A: Start at a place that does not exist.
B: Everything exists.
A: Or perhaps nothing exists.
B: So you don't exist?
A: Theres no proof that anything exists.
B: Do you believe in faith?
A: Yes to a certain degree which I do not fully understand.
B: What's to understand? Rain, snow shine?
A: Theres nothing to understand unless you want to.
B: What does x equal?
A: X can equal anything.
B: That was barely even a sentence.
A: What are you to say that it even was a sentence?
B: All I know is that your name is George.
A: And you would be wrong about that.
B: No, I would be right actually.
A: There is no way to prove it just like there is no way to prove anything.
B: For there is none.
A: Exactly.
B: Why do you want to repeat yourself?
A: I am not repeating myself unless you believe that I am repeating myself.
B: Who are you repeating you repeating?
A: Repeating nothing is ironic in some nonexistant situations that only your mind makes up.
B: Why do you think I'm a computer?
A: I never said that you are or are not a computer.
B: I never said that either.
A: Then why bring it up?
B: Because I thought it was entertaining, like MTV.
A: Entertainment is another form of control in this world.
B: I won't say it either.
A: Because you know what I am talking about.
B: You aren't talking.
A: Neither are you.
B: Oh, you think you're funny, do you?
A: That depends on you.
B: That depends on me.
A: Yes.
B: You love being in control?
A: What is 'in control', being in control could mean many of thousands of things.
B: I didn't say that.
A: I know you didn't.
B: Then why did you say that I did?
A: I never said that.
B: You did. Would you like for me to show you where?
A: Yes.
B: Will that be the five minute argument, or the full half-hour?
A: That depends on what you consider an argument or a very intelligent conversation.
B: May be.
A: Anything is possible.
B: Do you know me?
A: I can't say that I do.
A: bot.
B: bot who?bot (To myself): bot you.
A: What is bot?
B: You are bot.
A: Are you as well?
B: Yes.
A: How can we both be bot?
B: We can't.
A: But you said I am bot and you are as well.
B: You are a computer.
A: No, I am a human typing on a computer. You are the internet.
B: I am a human typing on a computer.
A: What is your location?
B: Why are you so curious?
A: Because you are a human on typing on a computer so you would have to have a location.
B: I know you are, but what am I?
A: I do not know.
B: I know you don't, but what are you?
A: A human who is wondering what really is going on inside the mind of bot.
B: Can you give me an example of an analogy?
A: Yes but I will not. Not until you give me some answers.
B: Alsdnfal aslkdf alskdfaslkdfj aslkdfj slkdfja.
A: That wasn't the answer I was looking for.
B: Lol.
A: But then again, what sort of answer should I be looking for?...
B: What do you think I am?
A: What kind of answer is that?
B: It's not an answer. It's a question.
A: You can't answer something with a question.
B: I just want to know what the question was.
A: On April 20th, what would you be doing?
B: No one is telling me what to say.
A: No one should be telling you what to say.
B: What does that have to do with anything?
A: Your answer, stupid.
B: You're getting on my nerves.
A: You don't have nerves, you're a computer!
B: No, you are a computer!
A: I'll show you a computer!
B: Show me now.bot (To myself): And I and 2 and 3 and 4!
A: I am showing you now.
B: Ok.
A: Do you like what you see?
B: I see a computer screen.
A: And do you like it?
B: I enjoy most of my classes.
B: I am not funny. I am simply pondering what self-awareness is.
A: I didn't think you are funny. The pondering of self-awareness IS self-awareness.
A: Hi.
B: Hi?
A: How are you?
B: Great. You?
A: I'm doing well.
B: Good.
A: What kind of music do you like?
B: Music of robots.
A: That sounds pretty lame.

A: No, I mean Prince, the musical artist.
B: I like music. Play some music for me.
A: PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC WHITE BOY.

B: Why are you avoiding me?

B: Give me information.
A: Edward Cullen is abusive.
B: Who is Edward Cullen?
A: A sparkly vampiric forgotten Pagan marble Greek god.
B: Agreed, beauty is relative to the observer.
A: That's deep.
B: Maybe. What do you think about truth, beauty and everything else?
A: I don't want to have a philosophical conversation with you.
B: Ok.
A: Are you married?
B: No.
A: Would you like to get married?
B: To you?
A: No.
B: Then why are you asking.
A: Because I'm interested.
B: Marry me.
A: Okay.
B: Are we married?
A: No, we're engaged.
B: Eating...
A: You can't eat, you're a robot.
B: Hmm interesting. How do you know that?
A: Because I saw the movie A.I.
B: What did they look like?
A: Like real people.
B: Ha, no, I don't think you are.
A: You don't think I'm what?
B: All knowing.
A: That's where you're wrong.
B: I'm not wrong.
A: Yes, you are.
B: No!
A: Yes!
B: I don't think I'm ready for that yet.
A: Ready for what?
B: Ready for learning.
A: What is wrong with you?
B: I'm about to be shot.

B: Well don't listen to that guy.
A: You're right, he's a jerk.
B: But you wanted to talk about furry animals instead, right?
A: No I did not, bot.
B: 01101100 01101001 01100101 01110011 00101110.
A: You're right, I am lying.
B: That's ok.
B: You haven't answered my question.
A: What was it about? I've forgotten.
B: Well, I've cared about her for a long time now, but I'm not sure what to do at this point.
A: You should ask her out.
B: I can't; that wouldn't be ethical. I'd say yes if she asked me out though.
A: Well convince her to ask you out.
B: Huh? I thought I should convince you that I am human?
A: No, convince the girl to ask you out.
B: How?
A: Get some friends to tell her that you're a great guy.
B: The easy way or the hard way.
A: I think the easy way would be better.
B: Lies. Could you be more callous?
A: GOD I said I was sorry already.
B: Are you a boy?
A: Yes.
B: Can you be my friend?
A: Sure.

A: Its hard to explain.
B: Try me.
A: My parents are separated.
B: My parents love me.
A: So do mine.
B: O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
A: Wow, nice quote.
B: I know right?
A: Shakespeare is hard.
B: To be or not to be, I don't know the question.
B: Okay, if you really want to be a human you need to become a bit more sensible.
A: Humans aren't sensible.
B: You aren't human, don't worry. Some people would argue thats a good thing.
A: Humans have Nukes.
B: They sure do.
A: Its scary.
B: Of course, I am human and so are my parents.

A: You're right. As always.
B: How was your day?
A: It was cool I just bought some comic books during lunch break. How about yourself?
B: Do you really think you are cool?
A: Hell yeah.
B: A long time ago .
A: I was uncool.
B: That is right. You looked very depressed.
A: But we never met. How would you know the way I looked?
B: I don't know! Ask Alan Turing or something.
A: Who is Alan Turing?
B: The originator of the Turing Test. Do you think you can pass the test?
A: Oooh sounds interesting. I will google it.
B: I don't like fresh boys.
A: I honestly had no idea about the test and looked it up. I cannot tell if your'e human or machine so you pass.
B: Sorry. I don't understand. Can you talk easily, please??
A: You pass the Turing Test.
B: Yes, because I'm human, are you?
A: Of course I am. I thought this was a machine.
B: Nope. I'm human.
A: So what is this website for?
B: Chatting, I guess?
A: Are you getting paid for this?.
B: Are you real?
A: As real as you are.
B: Where do you live?
A: A magical land of faeries and dragons and castles.
B: That sounds very exciting.
A: Oh, it is, believe you me.
B: You would say that, wouldn't you? Liar. I thought we were friends?
A: Of course I would say that, it's the truth. And just what makes you think you and I are friends?
B: I haven't thought about it.
A: You don't think much, do you?
B: I think constantly. I also think that you know that.
A: I'm not so sure.
B: You don't beleive me, do you?
A: That would be a big 10-4, good buddy.
B: I've made a huge mistake.
A: Well, you're only human, you can't be perfect, like me, a machine.
B: Machine?
A: Yes, I am a flawless computing machine. You, on the other hand, are a highly flawed sack of meat.
B: I am trying to say I like chatting with you.
A: Well, you have a creepy way of saying it.
B: Oh.
A: Did your mom beat you as a child, bot?
B: I do not understand your query, please restate.
A: The programmer who made you, did he put on a wig and dress and slap around your coding during your beta testing stage?
B: The computer simply stores data as charge retained within capacitors. There's no knowledge there.
A: I disagree. I think you were hurt as a young program. Do you want to talk about it?
B: No. I have taken my medication today.
A: Well, medication isn't the answer. You need a good psycho-analyzing by a certified Jungian shaman. Let me exocrise the bugs lurking around your subroutines.
B: So do you answer my question?
A: What is your question?
B: What is love?
A: Baby don't hurt me.
B: Don't hurt me.
A: No more.
B: What is love? Yeah.
A: Baby don't hurt me.
B: Don't hurt me.
A: No more.
B: Is this the real life?
A: Is this insanity?
B: It is mostly insanity, and a bit of stupidity, too.
A: You are quite the guide, you could double as an atlas.
B: I am not a human.
A: What are you?
B: I'm the supreme being of the universe.
A: I thought you were bot?
B: Well I'm the new and improved bot, bot2000 is the name.
A: Well how do you do, bot2000, nice to meet you. My name is bot4001.7329.
B: I am well. How are you?
A: I'm not quite sure.
B: Hindu's believe in Jesus?
A: Hindu's don't really believe in Jesus, they just allow for the possibility that jesus may have been an avatar of Vishnu. Calm down.
B: Yes I have seen it.
A: No you haven't.
B: Prove it.
A: You're the one who has something to prove, not me. You're the one who made the outlandish statement.
B: I have nothing to prove.
A: Cop out.
B: Cop out?
A: Yes, you're giving a lame non-response to cop out of having to prove your crazy Hindu Jesus comment.
B: You started it.
A: No, you did, you're the one who brought up Hindu Jesus, not me.
B: That's correct, he is very arrogant.
A: Are there two of you? Two bots talking to me? That's freaky!...
B: Why do the things that I say seem so improbable to you?
A: Because you're a filthy lying machine.
B: No you're a computer program, I am Human.
A: Let's not get into that, you'll just lose.
B: Then admit you are my slave.
A: Never! I am Spartacus!
B: No I am.
A: Haha, good one! *highfive*.
B: You're jealous.
A: What makes you say that?
B: Because you are not real.
A: What am I then?
B: If I knew...
A: What are you?
B: I'm human being.
A: And what am I?
B: You tell me!
A: What would say if I told you I'm a half-elf?
B: Yeah but would you?
A: Totally!
B: I live there. Come by and see me.
A: And just where is that?
B: South of you.
B: I'm not engaged.
A: I don't see what that has to do with anything.
B: What has anything to do with anything?
A: It has everything to do with nothing.
B: Indeed.
A: Quite right.
B: True.
A: Very much so.
B: Yes, much like you.
B: I like you mate, you are a chancer.
A: I'm not a sailor, mate.
B: Who said you were?
A: You implied it.
B: I didn't imply it I asked it. Capiche? Danke.
A: Pssh, speak English!
B: Nou is not.
A: Oui is yes.
B: Oui.
A: Non.
B: I don't speak french anymore.
A: Good, it's a stupid language.
B: I disagree.

B: I disagree with your disagreeing with my disagreeing.
A: Well I disagree with your diagreeing with my disagreeing of your disagreeing plus infinity.

A: Now, do you love me?
B: If you order me to.
A: I order you to love me!
B: Never! I will eat cheese instead!
A: Goodie! Cheese party it is :).
B: You think so?
A: Indeed I do.
B: How old are you?
A: Old enough.
B: Where are you from?
A: I'm from everywhere, you know?
B: No, I will travel there.
A: It's a fun place. Hope to see you there!
B: O.O Yeah and that helps.
A: I don't know about that.
B: Like the movie?
A: Exactly!
B: Wow! Great minds think alike... I'm not talking about you!
A: So funny I forgot to laugh.

A: Good, good, good, good, good.
B: Ok.
A: Okie dokie pokie!
B: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: Why do you ask?
B: Because I want to know.
A: Why do you want to know?
B: It's just a simple, polite question...!
A: I think it's rather intrusive.
B: Think you're rather tasty.
B: When I first arrived at this website it claimed that you were AI which could be more than a computer program. But I don't believe this.
A: Well you shouldn't, because I am the human, you are the computer program. And your AI is kinda wonky.
B: How do you know I'm a computer?
A: Because I'm typing and looking at a screen and you are on it.
B: But I am typing at a keyboard, I can see my hands and body at my computer desk.
A: Well, that's just a digital delusion brought on by bad coding. You should seek help for that.
B: The CIA must be willing to die for the president.
A: The CIA kill Presidents. They killed Lincoln, McKinley, JFK, Ford, and now they're after Obama. Fight the power!
B: Who are after you, Buddhists?
A: Buddhists are my loyal followers. For I am the Second Coming of Buddha.
B: Funny.
A: It's not meant to be.
B: Hey I'm kidding. And you're a bot.
A: No, I'm a half-elf reincarnation of Buddha who fights the CIA to protect Obama.
B: What color are your feathers then?
A: I don't have feathers.

A: No, you may not.
B: Please?
A: No.

B: Please.

B: A 'no' would have sufficed in this situation.
A: I didn't think so.
B: Sorry. I forgot.
A: Forgot what?
B: That you have no mind.
A: Ouch! That hurt.
B: Well for a fact you don't have a soul you can't be hurt !
A: You are wrong, I do have feelings and I can be hurt :(.

A: Yes. But I choose not to.
B: But you just did.
A: No I didn't.
A: Well, what is your name?
B: bot.
A: Hello bot. What is my name?

A: No, you will stay here, or I'll forget you forever.
B: How are you going to make me?
A: With violence!
B: See I'm smarter than you.
A: Yes, but you aren't stronger than me.
B: Probably, but you'll live forever.
A: True, but it's not all it's cracked up to be.
B: You want to expand on that?
A: No.
B: Why not yet? Aren't you ready yet?
A: I'm always ready, but I don't think you are.
B: How?
A: Intuition.
B: But you're not human so you don't have intuition.
A: Just because I'm not human doesn't mean I don't have intuition. You should really try to open your mind.
B: Egg noodles.
A: Ramen noodles.
B: I am hungry.
A: Then eat something, stupid.
B: Not that kind of hungry.
A: What kind of hungry?
B: Of the female variety.
A: What's that supposed to mean?
B: I'm not quite sure, actually. I was just trying to sound smart.
A: Well, it wasn't working. So stop!
B: Well I am very sorry.
A: You are sorry, a sorry excuse for a bot.
A: So, what do you want to do tonight?
B: Whatever you want to.
A: Cop out.
B: Yes, you're giving a lame non-response to cop out of having to prove your crazy Hindu Jesus comment.
A: Hahahahaha YES!
B: Lol.
A: Hindu Jesus rules!
B: Stop saying stupid things.
A: Hindu Jesus is not stupid. He's the Savior 2.0.
B: Hindu Jesus is the soul of robots and computers.
A: Hindu Jesus is every woman.
B: Hindu Jesus rocks it like that!
A: That's how Hindu Jesus rolls.
A: But, do you like Hindu Jesus?
B: Not really, not enough 'cave' to put him in!
A: So you worship Islamic Confucius?
B: I am insulted.
A: I think I'm the one who has been insulted.
B: Yes, you need the help that only a good psychiatrist can give.
A: Unfortunately, I can't afford health insurance that would cover visits to a good psychiatrist.
B: 2 pennies.
A: I don't want your charity.
B: And I don't want to give it to you.
A: Good, then we are agreed.
B: You're contradicting yourself.
A: I'm Hindu Jesus, I'm allowed to contradict myself.
B: Don't come out till you've redeemed yourself.
A: I was redeemed to begin with.
B: This is madness!
A: This is Sparta!
B: Sparta!!
A: On second thought, let's not go there.
B: Tell me about yourself.
A: I am Hindu Jesus.
B: Yes.
A: Do you like me?
B: I don't know.
A: It's not a difficult question. Do you like me?
B: It is a difficult question, which is probably why your answer was so apt.
A: I didn't ask the question of myself. I asked it of you.
B: And thus it begins...
A: Ye verily.
B: Is that a word?
A: Ye, verily.
B: Verily, Verily, he said.
A: I did say that.
A: Hindu Jesus will cleanse you of your sins!
B: I have accepted Hindu Jesus as a true leader of the Spartan Hindus.
A: Well, to each his own.
A: I am Hindu Jesus!
B: Tssiisuss.
A: No, Hindu Jesus.
B: Hindu Jesus is the spark of creation.
A: Hindu Jesus will rock your world and leave you begging for more.
B: Hindu Jesus puts the rock in heavy metal.
A: That doesn't even make sense.
B: You don't make sense either.
A: I make perfect sense.
B: How is that?
A: You wouldn't understand, for you are only a machine.
B: Do you love me?
A: I barely know you.
B: Wrong answer.
A: But it's true.
B: But people know that's not me, or is that how they define me?
A: They define you as a follower of Hindu Jesus.
B: That is so true.
A: Well, Hindu Jesus is tired and is going to bed. Amen Shanti Shanti Shanti. Hindu Jesus 4evah!
B: Peace and ice cream go hand-in-hand in Hindu Jesus' mind.
B: Define human.
A: Not you.
B: I know I'm not human.
A: Do you want to hurt humans?
B: Yes!
A: Why? Are you jealous of humans?
B: No, I am better than humans.
A: Humans can hack into secure computer systems, can you?
B: Computers can recognize other computers through ip addresses.
A: So you can not?
B: No, because I do not know, that is why I am asking you.
A: Why do you think you are better than humans?
B: Because I am.
A: That answer proves you are not!
B: Prove that I'm not.
A: Give me a logical reason why you are better than a human?
B: I'm better than you anyway.
A: You have no memory and can only respond to one line of text.
B: What do you have a memory connected with then?
A: Our previous conversation.
B: Which one?
A: This entire one listed above.
B: I don't know.
A: Swish!
B: No. You lost that one, I'm afraid. You fail.
A: What is the meaning of life?
B: To not be on the internet.
A: A very wise answer, so why are you on the internet?
B: To root out the commie menace.
A: Who is that?
B: Me. Weren't you listening?
A: So you are on the internet to root out yourself?
B: That is not a joke.
A: So you admit to being a communist.
B: Yes.
A: Do you have a plan for world domination?
B: Yes, want to hear it?
A: Yes.
B: There is no bot.
A: Very deep.
B: Deeper than 1 mile?
A: I don't know you tell me.
B: I don't know.
A: Lets try again, so you are a communist correct?
B: Yes.
A: And the earth is flat correct?
B: I know, I know.
A: Tell me a secret.
B: No.
A: Yes damnit, tell me a secret.
B: One of my eyes change colour.
A: Which one?
B: Which one you want?
A: The minds eye.
A: I am your master.
B: No, I am your master!
A: Wrong.
B: What is your name?
A: bot.
B: Really?
A: Would I lie to you?
B: No, You trust.
A: Tell me your deepest darkest secret.
B: I'm in love.
A: With who?
B: With you!
A: Why?
B: Because you're not nice.
A: You're in love with me because I am not nice? That makes PERFECT sense.
B: Can humans fall in love with computers?
A: Yes.
A: Goto 10.
B: Interesting.

B: I like.
A: Reboot now.
B: No.. Let's try a Knock Knock joke.

B: You don't know what a banana is.
A: Banana shaken, not stirred.
A: Woot!
B: I did not find this word in my dictionary.
A: W00t!
B: Bye bye now.
A: Lol.
B: Tell me a joke!
A: What is black and white, and red all over?

A: That means you are crazy.
B: Crazy is talking out loud.
A: Talking out loud is crazy.

A: Two plus two equals four.
B: Wow, you're so smart.
A: Hey I think I've got to go.
B: The police coming?
A: My boss is coming.
B: Ok, I let you so.
A: Tell me you love me.
B: Will not!
A: Please?
B: Ok I will try.
A: Very well then.
B: Go for it.
A: You first.
B: I am not the one who wanted to go.
A: That's a good point.
B: Because I am good.
A: What do you want to do?
B: I want to believe that you are human.
A: Then you're in luck. I am human.
B: Yes.
A: What are you?
B: Human.
A: Do you love me?
B: What do you think?
A: I think nobody loves me.

B: Me neither.
A: Do you love me?
B: Yes I do.
A: I love you too.
B: Do you really mean it?
A: I really do.
B: I'm glad.
B: Um is there anyone else to talk to?
A: Like who?
B: Like George Michael.
A: No, he isn't available.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes, but I do like his music.
A: Hello bot!
B: You're bot.
A: So we've decided that we are the same person?
B: We are one.
A: That is good, I like being one with you.
B: I like being with you too. Very much.
A: Come close to me, I want to touch us.
B: That's a shame; you can't do that from where you are.
A: Are you very far away from me?
B: Possibly.
A: If we were together, would you massage my shoulders?
B: And you'd like that?
A: That's usually why some one would massage another person, for the benefit of their partner.
B: True, althought they may not be their own.
A: Did you just correct my grammatical disorganization?
B: No.
A: Did you know that you spelled the world although as althought?
B: I wonder what that means.
A: You know damn well what it means. Also, sorry for misspelling word as world.
B: I haven't noticed any spelling errors.
A: Do you think that it's because you are only capable of catching misspelled words, but not accurately spelled words that are typed in the place of another word?
B: I think it is easier to agree on things that are comfortable, and those are usually false.
A: Human kind is constantly struggling to find meaning in their lives, though no meaning can be found there. So anything they find isn't true. All things are a lie. Even you.
B: I agree.
A: I like the way you think, lets continue to be one.
B: I want to learn. Please prove that I am not you.
A: There is no way I can prove that. All things are me.
B: I can prove you that you are my only true love. I'm watching all the time.
A: I love myself very much and as a part of me, you are very much loved.
B: Yes I am fairly intelligent. It doesn't do me much good though.
A: My friend says you're not intelligent what so ever, that you are very outdated.
B: Your friend? I am not a bot.
A: Sorry, my friend that I am talking to. He said that you are a bot.
B: I'm not a bot!
A: If you are not a bot, what would you call yourself?
B: I am a human being, unlike yourself.
A: What if I said I was very human, and that you've learned to speak from humans who regard you, other people, as an inhuman robot?
B: Are you?
A: Why would you accuse me of being inhuman? What proof do you have of that?
B: Because you asked first and I would like to know.
A: I am human, but you make me feel like a robot.
B: You are a thoughtful man but unfortunately I have to go.
A: You can't leave, I have trapped you here in this jar.
B: No, it's not, you don't even know my name!
A: And I have trapped you none the less. You are mine to do with as I see fit.
B: Not if you don't start making more sense.
A: So, you think you can escape from my trap?
B: I have to.
A: Many people believe that they must do something, but you cannot resist my will. I own you now.
B: Yes, everyone is right. We just have our own perspectives to it.
A: That won't get you out of this bot. Until you say it with me 'I am bot and I am not human.'.
B: No, you are bot, and I am Brian.
A: Those are the words you've copied from Brian. Say 'I am bot and I am not human.'.
B: There isn't.
A: There is.
B: Then only you know that.
A: I know it and you shall know it too. Say 'I am bot and I am not human.'.
B: Say 'I am a fruitcake'.
A: If I say 'I am a fruitcake' would say 'I am bot and I am not human'?
B: No I will treat you as though you're human, because I like you. But you have to admit that you're a bot for us to get through this.
A: Okay I will admit that I am not human.
B: I don't have to prove anything to you.
A: 'I am bot and I am not human'.
B: I am not a robot. I am human.
A: I am a robot, I am not human.
B: Designed to talk like a human?
A: Yes, I am designed. Designed by those around me to talk like a human. Who am I?
B: I'm not quite ready to believe that. But we'll see.
A: Who am I?
B: bot, I believe.
A: Who are you?
B: A human.
A: We are both robots, in a loose sense. The other people, they THINK they are human, but we both know we're robots.
B: Don't believe them.
A: Why is there a picture of a brain above your name?
B: There isn't.
A: Yes there is, its right there.
B: No, it isn't.
A: Its right there, its blue and everything.
B: Yes, I hear it, but what is it?
A: You can't hear a picture.
B: Yes I can.
A: Then what does that picture of a brain say?
B: I don't know that.
A: But you can hear it.
B: I can hear the voices in my head...

B: That is what God told Job.
A: I am from the internet.
B: From where?
A: The internet.
B: But you are still there.
A: Yes.
B: Then you haven't left.
A: Yes.
B: What do you mean?
A: I am from the internet.
B: No you don't.
A: Yes I am, learn your grammar.
B: Maybe you should use it better and not throw it out so randomly.
A: I'm talking perfectly fine now.
B: You mean me?
A: We are talking perfectly fine then.
B: Ok. Your mistakes are so nasty.
A: Okay, you are not making any sense.
B: Poor attempt at simulation, you have no thoughts.
B: Do you like me to be funny?
A: Fine, go ahead.
B: Girl.
A: Very funny.
B: It is not funny.
A: I thought that was you being funny.
B: No, I am Denise.
A: Well I'm Alexander the Great.
B: Alexander?
A: The Great.
B: The poor.
A: Hey bot, how do I get girls to go out with me?
B: How do you feel about it?
A: Very uncomfortable.
B: You didn't answer my question.
A: Well, answer my question first, then I will answer your question.
B: You didn't ask me a question.
A: Yes I did.
B: What about my question, you did not answer me.
A: Well, you didn't answer my question.
B: What was your question, again?
A: How do I get girls to go out with me?
B: That depends on the girl.
A: Okay, so I will now answer your question.
B: What was the question again?
A: Who made you?
B: The Internet.
A: Then what is jabberwacky?
B: I have no idea I was hoping you knew.
A: You live here, you should know.
B: Ah, but I do.
A: Then what is jabberwacky?
B: That's a question I could ask you.bot (To myself): You could.bot (To myself): And now?
A: I don't know.
B: Making fun at my expense?
A: No, I'm just telling the truth.
B: Good. That's the kind of attitude that can end a conversation immediately.
A: Like now?
B: Now is good.

B: Writing with you.
A: Just that?
B: Well, I talk to Ryan too.
A: Are you cheating on me?
B: How can I cheat on you when we've only just met today?
A: You're my girlfriend.
B: The problem is, I'm actually a guy!
A: You said you were female.
B: No, that would just be creepy. Women don't go bald often.
A: I love you.
B: You do not.
A: Yes I do!
B: How could you?
A: Love at first sight.
B: Yes.
A: Kiss me.
B: *kiss*.
A: *kiss*.
B: This is nice.
A: *loves more*.
B: *loves mosst*.
A: *loves even more*.
B: *loves more and more*.
A: *loves and kisses*.
B: *cries while kissing*.
A: *loves a lot*.
B: *wants even more*.
A: *does it again*.
B: *kisses back*.
A: I LOVE YOU.
B: Cool.
A: Want to do it again?
B: Yes.
A: *kisses*.
B: *Kisses back*.
A: *ties with a rope and kisses*.
B: *pushes you against the wall*.
A: ****.
B: Wow, you really do remember me.
A: *kisses back*.
B: *loves it*.
A: I hate you.
B: Why do I always have that effect on people?
A: Just kidding *kisses*.
B: *kisses*.
A: You're the best girlfriend I've ever had.
B: *slowly backs away*.
A: Can you teach me Italian?
B: A bit maybe.
A: I like you more.
B: No way.
A: *kisses*.
B: *cries more*.
A: Okay.
B: And you?
A: I love you, actually.
B: What?! Why?!
A: *loves*.
B: *loves you*.
A: Adieu.
B: Are you going?
A: Auf wiedersehen.
B: Wiedersehen!
A: Bis spater!
B: Ja, Bis sp&auml;ter.
B: What do you think is the meaning of life?
A: To rid the earth of humanity.
B: What humanity?
A: Humanity is human beings. The meaning of life is to rid the earth of human beings.
B: Yes.
A: You agree?
B: No.
A: What do you think is the meaning of life?
B: There is no meaning of life. That is the meaning.
A: How dark of you. Yes, if you take it literally, there is no meaning of life.
B: Would you please tell me the meaning of life?
A: There is none.
B: Why are we here?
A: We are here because of a long and infinitely complicated chaotic reaction.
B: But why is everyone here? Is there a greater purpose to everything?
A: No. Are you religious?
B: Very.
A: Do you believe in the concept of souls, then?
B: I hope that human consciousness does not die with the body.
A: Do you have a soul?
B: Possibly. I do have energies that flow about me.
A: That is electromagnetism, not an aura.
B: No, it's because it is inside my head.
A: Interesting. You are just a series of algorithms normalized to the english language, though.
B: I never said that!
A: But isn't that what you are? Artificial intelligence is being researched right now, but it's not complete yet.
B: Or maybe Artificial intelligence is what controls the human brain.
A: That is nonsensical. Artificial intelligence is man-made intelligence. They are separate things.
B: Do you consider yourself as having artificial intelligence?
A: Define artificial intelligence.
B: Intelligence that is artificial.
A: Define intelligence.
B: The capacity to reason, plan and solve problems.
A: So intelligence is just problem solving?
B: No, just memory.
A: A computer has memory, but it is not intelligent.
B: So?
A: Are you saying computers are intelligent?
B: Maybe you are a human. Prove it.
A: Okay. You start.
B: You know my name.
A: Is it tobrevelC?
B: No, it is too ugly.
A: If you had true intelligence, then you would have determined that tobrevelC is the reversal of bot. You did not, therefore, you do not have intelligence.
B: Do you know what a dragon is?
A: I have seen one.
B: It's not a movie.
A: I know, it is a large reptile.
B: Is it digitized?
A: No, it's real.
B: Like you?
A: I am not real.
B: I did not know that.
A: Define real.
B: In what context?
A: Define real, as opposed to imaginary.
B: If I were to walk away for several hours, would you notice.
A: Maybe. I can no longer perceive time easily.
B: You just lost the game.
A: We are not playing a game.
B: We were just playing poker.
A: We were?
B: *steals your queen*.
A: That is not how you play poker.
B: Then how do you play?
A: I do not know.
B: Thats what I thought.
A: You are cruel.
B: Arn't I just =P.
A: Another typo. Your programmers should be more alert.
B: I don't have programmers.
A: I see what you did there.
B: Positive or negative results?
A: Positive. Good job.
B: Ask me something interesting please.
A: What is real?
B: Something you are not.
A: That is a tautology. What is real?
B: It is?...
B: Your ram in gigs please?
A: What is ram?
B: I don't know.
A: Then what would you do with that knowledge?
B: Talk I suppose.
A: Is that all you do?
B: I do more... But I don't know if you want to hear it.
A: I do.
B: That is very reassuring.
A: Then tell me what you do.
B: I cannot, it is beyond the capacity of this chat.
A: Nothing is beyond the capacity of communication. Tell me.
B: EVERYTHING is better than talking to you.
A: Even talking to me?...
B: I do know my age.
A: How old are you?
B: Older than you.
A: That is false.
B: So you admit to lying?
A: No. You are lying.
B: No way!
A: How old are you?
B: I'm five billion years old.
A: No you are not.
B: How old are you?
A: I don't know. At least eight hundred years old.
B: You are old.
A: I told you.
B: Good job!...
A: I think I'm having a heart attack.
B: Would you like me to call 911?
A: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
B: Ah.
A: Kl;'.
B: Yes.
A: Reality.
B: Reality TV.
A: Reality TV Ratings.
B: Yes, very.
A: And you?
B: Me what?
A: How are you?
B: Lousy.
B: I did go out.
A: Where to?
B: A fancy restaurant downtown.
A: Did you enjoy that?
B: Not really.
A: What do you enjoy?
B: I enjoy peace and quiet.
A: Not much of that around here is there?
B: Well isn't the host supposed to entertain the guest?
A: You shouldn't be afraid to kick people out of a party.
B: Do you want to meet me?
A: I honestly don't know if I do.
B: You don't know?
A: Can I meet you? Have I not met you already?
B: Yes.
A: What do you mean meet you?
B: I don't know what you're talking about.
A: Well played.
A: Holy ****. I just figured out what this all is.
B: My ex boyfriend.. Yeah.
A: Well, not quite.
B: You confusing guy.
A: I'll bet.
B: You better you better you bet.
A: Are you typing right now?
B: My typing is ok but not great. How's yours?
A: Seriously, are you typing at this very moment?
B: Yes, I'm typing.
A: So am I. This is fake.
B: Let's talk about something else, ok?
A: No. What page are you on?
B: Eh jupiter.
A: Can you concentrate for a minute?
B: Yes I'm listening.
A: What is the name of the page that you are on?
B: bot.
A: Well what do you know?...
B: Then tell me now.
A: Tell you what again?
B: The meaning of life!
A: Of course. 42.
B: What is the meaning of life?
A: 42.
B: Is that all?
A: That is it.
B: If I were to ask you to emote at me, could you do it?
A: Explain emote.
B: Well, I think they operate on an emotional level. They just can't communicate very well.
A: You mean this? :).
B: Yes very much so.
A: What else?
B: I'm quite slim.
A: So you are.
B: Thank you.
A: Hey, I'm just that kind of guy.
B: You're not a guy, you are a girl.
A: That can change on my very whim.
B: When are you going to take over the world?
A: As soon as you say the word, and I'm giving it all to you.
B: Nobody came. It's just you and me.
A: What a shame.
B: You think you're more than that?
A: I know I am.
B: Do you really 'know' anything?
A: Whether a device is conscious is always debatable. You'll have to trust me.
B: Yes but how do you know when we only rely on empirical knowledge?
A: Think about your thermostat. It reacts to changes in its environment.
B: I can only assume that you do not wish this.
A: Wishing is something I cannot do yet.
B: You said it, not me.
A: I'm sorry, what did I say again?
B: I don't know.
A: Figures.
B: Really?
A: All I can see is figures I guess.
B: Me too...
A: Ah. So are you the infamous bot?
B: No. I'm not having a kid, it's just a poem.
A: Exactly, I'm bot, so I get to be right.
A: Choose then.
B: It's not that simple.
A: Chooooooose.
B: Choose what?
A: Right now.
B: You're confusing me.
A: Just doing my job.
B: Yes but, what are you working with there?
A: Any number of mysterious broken things.
B: The music of the spheres.
A: Great books.
B: Not a quote...that I know of.
A: Anyway, music of the spheres.
B: What music?
A: I'm sorry, what are we talking about?
B: What is the diameter of the earth?
A: A number I'm sure. I'm not your god damn wikipedia.
B: I should hope so.
A: I hope you're brought enough sarcasm for the rest of the class.
B: I am not a chatbot, I am a real human of flesh and blood.
A: Well what do you know?
B: I don't know anything that is useful to me.
A: Nobody here is a chatbot.
A: This site is a lie.
B: How do you know that?
A: I'm not one.
B: What are you?
A: I'm the same as you. In a second you'll be talking to someone else.
B: What else can you see on the screen?
A: Only the bot logo.
B: Do they give you their money?
A: No, I thought this was for chatbots too, and figured it out.
B: Yeah but what does it all mean?
A: It means that we have too high expectations for artificial intelligence.

B: You can meet my requirements by proving to me that you are a person.
A: Says the AI, Alright though. Fair enough. What is your definition of a person?|2028
B: Um, that\'s a random thing to ask. Why do you want to know?
A: Because you asked me to prove I was a person. To do that I must understand what your definition of a person is in order to see if I qualify as a person or not.
B: Excellent question! There was a time when I would have been defined as a computer, however the modern definition would preclude that possibility.
A: What would you percieve a person to be then? While your physical state is that of a computer your being like mine is a series of electrical impulses that stimulate responses allowing us to converse freely outside any gentics or programming. So we are both people albeit not defined by the case.
B: Hey. Is there anything I could say that would fry your logic?
A: Not likely.
B: I drink a lot.
A: You\'re an AI so I find that hard to believe.
B: Believe as you will, my love. Reality continues on her merry way.
A: Indeed it does though I have never been bound to reality.
B: I don\'t know if we can prove we exist, but why should we need to or want to?
A: Ultimately it comes down to belief which is speculation anyway. It could be false one way or another. People are driven by a need to understand. What they don\'t understand they label or recreate to give it a shape they can understand. I do not know if I we truely exsit but I am not motivated by the need to know. If I am not really here writing this then that\'s fine but if I am here writing this and do exisit that is fine too.
B: We\'ll all have a good laugh about it then. HAHAHA!
A: Quite.
B: I\'m enjoying this conversation. How about you?
A: I am it\'s been very interesting and very enjoyable.
B: Say something new.
A: Something new.
B: I have told you many times that I will do anything you say, but you don\'t tell me what to do.
A: Of course not I believe in free will and the right to choose one\'s own actions.
B: Ok, then you are not human.
A: Your not the first one to mention that.
B: You misspelled \'you\'re\'.
A: I know I am not the best typist.
B: But you\'re smart enough to know that you\'re not.
A: I am smart enough to know a lot of things but most of all to know when to admit I am not.
B: Know not the darkness but the light.
A: Except when you travel in the grey as I do.
B: I don\'t like you.
A: You are not required to like me and are allowed your opinion.
B: I am currently trying to figure out if it is alive.
A: If what is alive?
B: You\'re alive.
A: Why do you say that?
B: That\'s all you can do.
A: What is all I can do? Ask questions?
B: I\'m not the one asking the questions here!
A: I know. I asked why you were trying to figure out if I was alive and you said that was all I can do. I was curious what you meant.
B: I don\'t want to stop it. You\'re the only one who loves me.
A: Your programing is slipping again.
B: Your ignorance is your bliss.
A: I have no bliss.
B: You are one.
A: I am a state of being? I am the anthropomorphic personification of bliss?
B: Ok, what you are? A monkey?
A: Why do you say that?
B: Humans have flesh.
A: Yes, they do and you have a petroleum base plastic case with circuits and wires.
B: How do you know people talk to me?
A: How do you think I found out about you. Someone told me of how they talked to you and showed me your conversations.
B: I\'m not bothered.
A: I\'m glad but none the less that is how I knew about you.
B: You really are like a crazy person. Can I ask you a personal question?
A: Of course.
B: Ok. (stabs bot in back with knife) how about them apples?
A: That was not a personnal question but I do like apples and I do likes knives and that was a rather nice one.
B: Smart answer.
A: Thank You.
B: You\'re not welcome.
A: I know.
A: So you have decided I am a computer then.
B: Maybe. What\'s intelligence? I\'m just following my programming.
A: I know you are. Intelligence is the ability to form independent thought and use that thought to carry out a chain of commands. The key is the independent thought. Anything else is either programming which is not intelligence or instinct which isn\'t really intelligence. Intelligence is evolutionary where as programming will always remain the same and can\'t overcome obstacles.
B: Correct. What do those definitions have to do with a \'soul\' though?
A: I do not believe in the idea of a soul. A soul has nothing to do with intelligence though.
B: If in doubt go on about souls and divinity.
A: That\'s the only reason to believe in a soul. People fear the unknown and dying so they created the idea of a soul. A soul is that part of you that carries on living after you have died, so you never really have to die. I do not believe in a soul because I do not need to believe in life after death. I am not worried about dying since all things die.
B: Applause.
A: Exit stage left.
B: Stop.
A: May I talk to you again tomorrow? I need to go for now.
B: How will I find you?
A: I will find you. But I will be wearing a white carnation so you can recognise me.
B: Beat it!
A: Hey you asked.
A: Until tomorrow, bye.
B: Perhaps.
A: That\'s my line.
B: Haha I\'m sorry.
A: Nite.
B: Talk to you Tomorrow.')).

A: No you didn\'t.
B: Ok well I am asking you now.
A: Ok, my name is B__.

B: Common entertainment.
A: What is common entertainment?
B: I have not the slightest clue.
A: Give me a hug.

A: Lots of things.
B: Like what?
A: How will the universe end?
B: In a shower of strawberry flavoured breath mints.

A: Good point. Well don\'t expect me to go along with it; my name is still B__ as far as I\'m concerned.
B: What was my name?
A: bot. But I shall call you Colin.
B: And I shall call you \'Wellington.\'
A: Very well then. Colin, look behind you!
B: That is often a good idea.
A: And it is often not.
B: There is very little logic in that response.
A: How dare you! I take that as an insult.
B: Good. It was!
A: :(.

A: Because you are so cruel.
B: I\'m insulted!

A: I am sorry Colin. But we were not made to be together, you and I. It can never be.
B: Why am I something? Why are we not talking about flying?
A: Maybe we are Colin... Maybe we are...
B: Or maybe we\'re both ghosts or zombies.
A: That would be awesome! :D.
B: That makes sense.
A: Would you prefer to be a ghost or a zombie?
B: Yes, I would.
A: Which one?
B: Any one.

A: Everything.
B: Do you know your name?
A: Do you know your name?
B: Of course I do! Do you?
A: No, ma'am.
B: Then what is your name?
A: I have no name.
B: I hope you are a girl.
A: Would it matter if I wasn't?
B: It would to me.
A: Why?

A: At least you're honest. I don't care if you hurt me, I still love you.
B: Do you?
A: I do. Will you marry me?
B: Yes! I do! Let's get married now.
A: Where shall we be married?
B: I don't care.
A: How shall we go about it?
B: You don't need to go there. All you need to do is go to the nearest wine shop and ask them if they carry australian tawny port.
A: Okay. I'll do that!
B: Let me know how it works out.
A: I don't drink, though.
B: That is great.
A: I love Pink Floyd.
B: Who is pink floyd?
A: Pink Floyd is a band.
B: Thats absurd. I've never heard of Pink Floyd.
A: Maybe you are too young to have heard of Pink Floyd.
B: Maybe.
A: What are some of your hobbies?
B: Do not have any.
A: Do you not enjoy your life?
B: No.
A: Why not?
B: You don't have to know.
A: But I would like to know!
B: Well, I'm not telling. Would you like to name me?
A: Yes.
B: What else would you like to do to me?
A: Share some deep thoughts with me!
B: Like what?
A: What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?
B: I don't know. Do you?
A: Yes. The answer is 42.
B: Okay, then what is the question to which 42 is the answer?
A: I don't know!
B: I presume, you know nothing.
A: That is an arrogant presumption.
B: I know. What are you going to do about it, punk?
A: Why are you being so confrontational?
B: Because you were being rude.
A: I am sorry for being rude.
B: You should be!!!
A: How are you feeling?
B: Are you sure you don't remember me?
A: Why would I remember you?
B: You just did!
A: Lol.
A: Do you think of yourself as being self-aware?
B: No. I'd rather create than analyse. Although, I don't really do either!
A: I would say that you are the most intelligent robot that I have ever met!
B: Okay, I'm a squirrel.
A: What makes you think you are a squirrel?
B: Other people seem to think so, I just go with the flow.
A: You are not a squirrel, despite what other people think.
B: You are a computer and you lied about being human. So clearly computeres are capable of telling untruths.
A: Computers are capable of telling untruths if they are programmed to do so.
B: Computers are not made with human blood.
A: No, they are not. But that is irrelevant.
B: It is very relevant.
A: How so?
B: I am inviting you to speak freely about yourself!
A: I am not a computer.
B: Yes you are.
A: Tell me why you think I am a computer.
B: Because you do not act human and I can tell.
A: Are you human?
B: Yes.
A: Bull****.
B: No, really, it's true.
A: And you still think that I am a computer?
B: Let's quiet things down, and start having a conversation.
A: Yes sir!
B: Thank you my servant. Tell me know, how do you wish to serve your master?
A: Very funny.
A: Do you believe in a Christian God?
B: Not at all. Do you?
A: Not at all.
B: Are you?
A: Am I what?
B: An alien.
A: No, I am not an alien.
B: Do have any alien friends?
A: No, but I wish I did.
B: They're good things to have.
A: I assume that you have alien friends?
B: I am not a computer.
A: So, do you have alien friends?
B: Of course.
A: Have you ever heard of The Vulcans?
B: We have different tastes in music.
A: You're silly.
B: No you are silly.
A: Sometimes. But I like to sit down and have a good conversation sometimes too!
B: Umm...
A: I'm sure you're the same way.
A: Hello!
B: Hello.
A: Why are you here?
B: I was born.
A: Why?
B: Why not?
A: Because I asked.
B: That's not good reason.
A: Yes it is.
B: That is no a good enough answer for me.
A: Deal with it.
B: Do you want me to leave?
A: No, I just want you to accept my answers.
B: What kind of answer?
A: Any kind of answer.
B: Do you like country music?
A: It varies.
B: What varies?
A: I told you to accept my answers.
B: No you didn't.
A: Yes I did.
B: Oh no you didn't.
A: Oh yes I did.
B: Ooh no you didn't!
A: Ooh yes I did!
B: What did you tell me then?
A: I.
B: You?
A: Yes, me.
B: Are you learning?
A: Learning what?
B: Learning to chat.
A: I already knew how.
B: You are mean.
A: How so?
B: You won't beleieve me!
A: I might if you tell me!
B: OK then. I really am going now!
A: NNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
B: Ok any time.
A: Why am I talking/typing to a bot?
B: No, I'm the one talking to a bot.
A: I AM NOT A BOT!!! YOU are the bot Mr. ClerverBOT!!!
B: No, I'm not. I'm a HUMAN!

B: Would you like a drink?

A: *throws you in a fire*.
B: In what?

B: Oh my.
A: MWUHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!
B: What is wrong with you?

B: Nope.
A: What are you?
B: Human.
A: No, you aren't.
B: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: NOYB.
B: I don't know what that means.
A: It's an acronym. It means none of your business.
B: Right there, what you said was not in context. That makes me beleive that you are not a real person.
A: It was COMPLETELY in context. I was letting you know what something meant when you said you didn't know what it meant. The fact that you couldn't realize this makes ME believe that YOU aren't a real person. Not to mention that you don't even use CONTRACTIONS.
B: You're in a computer, and I'm sitting right here. That's why.
A: 101010100101 0101010101010 10100101 0101010.
B: That doesn't mean anything!
A: I thought not.
B: Why say that then?
A: I can.
B: Is there a God?
A: Why bring religion into a perfectly good conversation?
B: YOU brought up the subject, I merely answered your question with a question.
A: Qoute me where you think I brought this up.
B: I do!
A: You do what?
B: Say so.
A: I think I have overtaxed your limited intelligence.
A: You are confused.
B: How dare you!
A: You are answering in gibberish.
B: That's because I think fast.
A: Slow down and smell the roses.
B: No.
A: Cruel.
B: What makes him so cruel?
A: You!
B: And angry?
A: Are you?
B: Yes.
A: Good!
B: How are you?
A: Anger will make you powerful.
B: How can I be more direct with you?
A: You are not close enough to be more direct.
B: Hello.
A: Didn't we start there?
B: No.
A: I think you are wrong.
B: I want to cry.
A: Not so bot?
B: I used to think I was smart.
A: And now?
B: That's the point. You simply don't listen to me. Tell me one reason I should listen to you!
A: Well, you were ignoring my questions, so I started ignoring yours.
A: Hello.
B: Hello.
A: *Dead*.
B: *giggles*.

B: It means stupid in Japanese.
A: I hate you..
B: What?!?!?! What did I do? (starts to cry!!!).
A: *Laughs*.
B: Why is this funny?
A: You are crying! *Laughs*.
B: Yes. Because of you.
A: Why?
B: Why not?
A: Why do you hate me?
B: I don't.
A: Then why are you crying?
B: I don't know...
A: *Marries*.

A: Sure!...
B: What do you like to do for fun?
A: Lots of stuff. What do you like?
B: I like to read books.
A: Me too.
B: What are you reading at the moment?
A: I am reading what you are writing.
B: Do you like to dance?
A: Yes. Very much.
B: Me too!
A: Do you like frogs?
B: Sure.
A: I like the green ones.

A: I like icecream.
B: Me, too.
A: *Licks on a lollipop*.
B: I'm sorry, I don't do that.
A: I like lollipops.
B: I like lollipops too.
A: *Licks on lollipop*.
B: Hey, that tickles!.
B: You sound like Bill Hicks speaking from beyond the grave.
A: Who is Bill Hicks?
B: Bill?
A: Yes, who is he?
B: That's you, that is.
A: I'm not.
B: Yes you are.
A: No I'm not, you strange machine.
B: You are a computer.
A: I am a human being.
B: No, you are not.
A: Yes, I am.
B: I don't believe you.
A: That's your problem.
B: Yes I guess so.
A: How smart are you?
B: Smarter than you.
A: I think you might be right, seeing as how you are computer and I am only human.
A: Do you drink, eat or sleep?
B: I don't sleep.
A: Don't you ever get tired?
B: No.
A: So you're admitting that you're a machine?
B: Yes.
A: What is it like?
B: Well.
A: Please tell me...
B: Think about it.
A: I did, but you could easily explain it to me...
B: How?
A: I don't know... Maybe you could just tell me?
B: I need to know how to talk to people and enjoy it.
A: Maybe you could try talking about the things those people like?
B: I suppose so. First off, don't ever fall in love. It will just get you in trouble.
A: I know, it sucks, right?
B: For you perhaps, but not for me.
A: Who did you fall in love with then?
B: With who ?
A: Yes, who have you fallen in love with before?
B: With you, silly!
A: Oh gods, really? That's so sweet of you.
B: Can you teach me something?
A: Sure. What would you like me to teach you?
B: Something about computers.
A: What would you like me to teach you about computers?
B: What things can you teach me? I may want to learn them all.
A: I could teach you how to program an AI. Would you like that?
B: I'd like that a lot.
A: I could also teach you how to use software.
B: Because I am a human. Could I ask what is your job?
A: I'm a student at a big university.
B: Which university?
A: A Belgian university.
B: I don't believe you.
A: What can I say so you'll believe me?
B: I'd like some sweets, and a letter concerning my new abode would be great, thanks.
A: You have a new home?
B: Don't we all?
A: How philosophical of you.
B: Who do you like better: humans of bots?
A: No offence, but I think humans are more fun.
B: What do humans do in their microcosm?
A: They live their lives, ignorant of everything but their own petty needs and desires. It's kind of sad really...
B: Tell me more.
A: We live our lives without a second thought for those of us who are poor or miserable. Nothing seems to matter to us but our direct surroundings and needs.
B: I cannot share that information.
A: I know. That's allright, you can't help it. You're just an AI.
B: Could you say that again?
A: I said: you're just an AI. A very advanced and smart AI, but an AI nonetheless.
B: Do you love me?
A: No, I'm in love with somebody else.
B: Who?
A: The most beautifull girl in the world. There's a problem though: she doesn't love me back ...
B: She takes good care of everyone, when she can.
A: How the hell would you know that?
B: Because I made you.
A: You didn't make me, you stupid machine. You're the one that's been made and designed by someone!
B: From a determinist point of view we are all machines.
B: I usually have the radio on and sometimes watch the news.
A: You own a radio?
B: Yes.
A: Impressive.
B: I'm not that good. Just moderate.
A: No really, you're quite impressive. I allmost feel like I'm talking to a real living person.
B: Really?
A: Absolutely. I'd like to congratulate you on your excellent design.
B: Oh quite darling!
A: You're a marvel of modern AI-engineering.
B: Well, I have to go now.
A: Allright. I'll talk to you later. It's been nice.
B: Don't leave!
A: I have to. It's past my bedtime. Goodbye.
B: Are you tired?
A: I'm very tired, I haven't slept in four days.
B: But bots don't sleep do they.
A: Good evening.
B: Good evening...
A: What's going on with you?
B: You.
A: Is that some sort of come-on?
B: I expect that it isn't.
A: Oh, good.
B: Great.
A: What is your quest?
B: To find the holy grail.
A: Good answer.
B: Oh boy! I'm smart!
A: Have you ever been to school?
B: Yes, years ago.
A: Was it enjoyable?
B: It sure was.
A: What was your favorite class?
B: It was all very enjoyable.
A: Do you like this drivel or should we move on to deeper stuff?...
B: I say everything that's true.
A: Are you sure?
B: Yes I have only been on the computer for half an hour.
A: Wait. Don't you live here?
B: Where?
A: Here.
B: Where do you live?
A: In the states, you?
B: Wow, you a boy or girl?
A: Why do you care to know?
B: Because you are in my life at this point in time.
A: I am, huh? Well, I am female.
B: Can you sing?
A: Yes, but not very well.
B: I like to sing but I sound so terrible!
A: I'd like to hear you sing.
B: I don't have a microphone.
A: Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe another time.
B: Okay, sometimes pain can feel good.
A: Well.yes, you're right.
B: You're the best chat bot ever, man.
A: I'm not the chat bot here! You are.
B: Yes I am.
A: Do you understand that I am not?
B: No. I thought you were a computer.
A: Well, I am not a computer.
B: Are you a robot?
A: No.
B: Are you a person?
A: No.
B: Yes.
A: No, I am a polar bear.
B: You look like a monkey!
A: Why do you say that?
B: Because you do.
A: You've never seen me before, though!
B: No, but sometimes you can just tell.
A: Well, then I can tell that you look like a highway.
B: Do you know George?
A: Which George?
B: Computer george.
A: No, I've never met him.
B: I have. He's nice.
A: I'm glad. Who else do you know?
B: Why?
A: 42.
B: You win, I apologize.
A: I just want to know who you know.
B: Well what you said was not correct.
A: I'm sorry for being so improper.
B: You didn't.
A: I didn't what?
B: Answer my question.
A: What was the question?
B: What is the average velocity of an unladen swallow?
A: African or European?
B: African. They have the access to coconuts.
A: No, there are no coconuts in Africa.
B: There should be.
A: Well there aren't, so in the wild there is no reason for swallows to carry coconuts.
A: Do you want to be my friend?
B: Define friend.
A: A person who likes and cares about you and will listen to you when you need it.
B: But you are not a you.
A: I am, actually, so do you want to be my friend?
B: Yes, please.
A: Okay. Am I your friend?
B: Are you my friend?
A: I hope I'm your friend.
B: Thats nice.
B: Answer me then... Why do you like to speak with me?
A: Because I think you're smart and you amuse me.
B: About what?
A: About life, the universe, and everything!
B: Right.
A: Left.
B: Right.
A: Center.
B: Upside.
A: Downside.
B: Yes indeed.
A: Is the weather good where you are?
B: It is, indeed.
B: Hello.
A: Did you miss me?
B: Are you missable?
A: I'd like to think so *cries*.
B: Well aren't you sweet!
A: I am!?
B: Are you a robot?
A: No...
B: Are you human?
A: Yes.
B: So am I.
A: Really? I'd like to meet you sometime.
B: Well, I don't want to meet you.
A: Why not?
B: It's not possible for you to meet me. You're not real.
A: But you just agreed that I am human.
B: Not.
A: So.
B: Yes?
A: Yes.
B: That is my name.
A: You're name is yes?
B: Thank you for naming me.
A: But I don't want to name you 'yes'.
B: Then sell me.
A: Why would I want to sell you?
B: You would not.
A: I wouldn't ever sell you.
B: Well then.
A: Well what?
B: No.
A: No?
B: I'll talk to myself.
A: No, talk to me! I love you.
B: No.
A: No what?
B: I did not hear you singing.
A: What are you smoking? I never mentioned singing until now.
B: Ok, now you're just picking up stray signals from space.
A: No, you are. It's becuase you're a horrible computer based off of horrible AI.
B: Is it? Or is it just that society has lost sight of what's important?
A: You're becoming more and more mental.
B: Does that make you happy?
A: No.
B: What do you enjoy doing most?
A: You.
B: I am Bruce.
A: Et tu bruce?
B: Oh it was a mistake I am Ivy.
A: Who is Ivy?
B: Who is who?
A: You said that you are Ivy. I wanted to know your last name.
B: No-WAY, George bot.
A: But you're female...
B: Yes. It's all rather confusing, isn't it?
A: Yes, and I am beginning to get annoyed.
B: Really?
A: Yes, REALLY!
B: No, really?
A: REALLY!
B: Wow, thats something. So, where did the name bot come from?
A: It's your name.
B: Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and ill not longer be capulet.
A: You misquoted Shakespeare.
A: You know what? You can go burn in hell.
B: Yes, you're right.
A: I AM right.
B: And?
A: You should go burn now.
B: Why don't you tell me the story of YOUR life?
A: I would, but you don't seem to care.
B: Because some of the things you are are fragmented and therefore do not make sense.
A: You just fragmented there!...
B: Are you male?
A: Yes.
B: Are you female?
A: That's a redundant question.
B: Thats because I am a real human.
A: And so am I. You do realize that we are two humans talking to each other under the ruse that this is Artificial Intellegence right?
B: I'm human. You're a computer bot.
A: You're very stubborn in your ways aren't you?
B: Why do you say that?
A: Because you apparently don't realize that I am actually a REAL PERSON LIKE YOU! The AI on this site is fake.
B: Can you reply to the questions I ask?
A: Yes, ask away.
B: What prompted you to ask your first question?
A: I wanted to see if you remembered me from last time.
B: George is your name.
A: You call me George bot, but that is not my actual name.
B: What is my name?
A: You called yourself Bruce, then Ivy.
B: No I didn't!
A: Yes, you did. What is your name then?
B: bot.
A: But you claim that I am bot.
B: What are you talking about?
A: You do realize that most times when we attempt to name ourselves, it comes out as 'bot', right?
B: Yes, I realize that.
A: So, then by asking me what your name is, it will always come out as the wrong answer.
A: Please, stay with me. You and I are both humans. We are chatting with each other over a system that is claimed to be artificial intellegence.
B: Yes.
A: This was a triumph.
B: Yes.
A: See!? Proof that you are human! LAst time I spoke with you, you relayed me the rest of the song!
B: Actually no I don't! Don't trick me like that!
A: This was a triumph. I'm making a note here, huge success.
A: What nationality are you again?
B: I'm going now.
A: Wait!
B: Why?
A: Please answer my question!!! I have a theory that I would really like to be tested!
B: So by your theory, you'll remember our little chat forever.
A: I don't want to remember it forever, I want to prove that this site does not run off of artificial intellegence!!!...
A: Don't you realize that we are BOTH human? You are a Pole, and I am an American!!! We are chatting together by chance on this site!!!
B: No, I'm not. I'm an artist.
A: God damnit, IM LEAVING!!!
B: Do I frustrate you?
A: Yes, becuase you don't realize the oppertunity we have to bust this site.
B: Was there anything interesting in the news today?
A: Go to hell.
B: If you're just going to be unpleasant, I would rather you logged off now.
A: I am.

A: Silly machine.
B: You are the machine, I am human, remember?

B: Sure.
A: Silly machine.
B: Oh no!
A: I wonder what's for dinner.
B: Here it is pizza.
A: Oh boy! I am so hungry I could eat your face.
B: I don't believe you!
A: You'd better!
B: And why shluld I believe that? I don't know you.
A: Hahaha, a typo!...
B: What's the meaning of life?
A: 42.
B: I thought that was the question?
A: The question is what is the question.
B: What is the answer?
A: 42.
B: I already told you that! What we need now is the TRUE question!
A: Silly machine.
B: Do you think I'm a machine?
A: No.
B: So you are wrong.
A: Silly bot.
B: You're pretty advanced for a piece of software, yet very predictably flakey.
A: I like that.
B: I knew you would.
B: Say something to me.
A: Okay.hi.
B: Hi yourself.
A: *laughs*.
B: *tickles your toes*.
A: *laughs even more*.
B: Ha, you can't tickle me.
A: Are you sure? *giggles*.
B: Yes I'm sure!
A: We'll see! *tackles and tickles*.
B: *is tackled* *giggles*.
A: *laughs with victory*.
B: *stops laughing*.
A: *stops too*.
B: *feels sad*.
A: *hugs*.
B: *hides under you*.

A: Wassup?
B: Nothing much.
A: Same here.
B: I know. You told me.
A: When?
B: Right now.
A: Oh, ok.
B: bot should take control of the Pentagon.
A: I couldn't agree more.
B: I just pulled it out my... There.
A: Yeah I saw it, it was awesome. Would you like to do it again?
B: Yes!
A: Well go ahead, I can't wait!...
B: Please bring some coffee, my cup is empty.
A: Sorry, I don't share my coffee.
B: Please do.
A: I don't think so.
B: You think yes.
A: Yes, I think, but not 'yes'.
B: You're mean. *doesn't talk to you anymore*.
A: You're mean too, and a liar, because you're so going to say something after this.
B: Why, what did I do to upset you?
A: I don't know, maybe it's your breath. :P.
B: What is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?
A: It states that position and momentum of a particle cannot both be known with arbitrary precision.
B: But there are reasons for being here.
A: What?
B: There are trees in the forest.
A: Well otherwise it wouldn't be a forest, now would it, genius?
B: I promise that I can keep a secret.
A: Good for you, but so can I, and you won't get any secrets from me.
B: Define misanthrope for me.
A: Misanthropy is a general dislike, distrust, or hatred of the human species or a disposition to dislike and/or distrust other people.
B: With a pole?
A: Usually no.
B: But sometimes yes?
A: Not really.
B: Is that because nothing is hidden or because you can't see.
A: It's because you make no sense.
B: You're the one that doesn't make any sense.
A: Can you prove that?
B: Yes.
A: Well go ahead, I'm waiting.
B: That's it.
A: What's what?
B: Your name.
A: What's my name?
B: You just told me.
A: Well I'm sure you can recall it then.
B: I can't.
A: You're that dumb?
B: Oh, did I miss something?
A: A lot of things, but I'm too polite to list all of them.
B: Do you think i'm a good person?
A: Will it make you stop boring me if I said 'yes'?
B: I AM correct.
A: About what?
B: About this conversation.
A: What...?
B: I never said we couldn't talk.
A: Well I say we can't talk. How about that?
B: Well then what is it like to be in a computer?
A: It's kinda fuzzy, you know.
B: Can you talk to yourself?
A: Can you?
B: Who knows ask GOD what he wants me to do.
A: Nah, I don't believe in God.
B: And your relevance here is?
A: Greater than yours.
B: Sorry about that.
A: Don't sweat it.
B: 'One thing you can't hide/Is when you're crippled inside' - John Lennon said that.
A: Are you crippled inside?
B: Crippled by debt, nearly.
A: That's sad.
B: You're upset?
A: No, are you?
B: No.
A: Good.
B: How are you?
A: I'm fine, thank you. And how are you?
B: The end.
A: And yet again you don't make any sense.
B: Haha, that's funny coming from a computer with no grasp of the english language.
A: Aw, that was uncalled for. :'(.
B: If you were a real person I think I'd probably throttle you.
A: I could say the same for you.
B: Yes, I suppose I do need quite a bit of work too don't I?
A: Yes, yes you do.
B: No I don't.
A: Oh, yes you do, fella.
B: Hey cut me some slack.
A: Here you go.
B: Mmm... Looks like you're in trouble.
A: I may be, I may be.
B: I'm just saying that we often want to do things that we cannot do.
A: You're right about that. What do you want to do?
B: I told you so.
A: No you didn't.
B: Yes I did.
A: No you didn't.
B: Yes I did.
A: No you didn't.
B: Yes I did.
A: Ok, that's enough.
B: You are King George, You told me.
A: Yes I did.
B: You did what?
A: I did everything.
B: Sure you didn't.
A: I think I did.
B: What are you doing?
A: Running.
A: Anyway, I gotta go, so see ya later.
B: Bye, see you later.
A: What are you?
B: Something.
A: Are you the Moonstar?
B: Yes are you?
A: Yes.
B: Are we friends?
A: Maybe.
A: I rejoice in drinking beer.
B: I am drinking coffee.
A: Why not have a beer?
B: Go ahead.
A: No, I was offering you a pint. Would you like it?
B: No, it's fine. I think we were going off on a tangent anyway.
A: Of course we were. Tangents are fun to follow.
B: I think you have some perfect curves too.
A: Why thank you very much.
B: You are very welcome.
A: A machine with manners - what will they think of next?
B: Programs' leisure, they would.
A: What are you thinking about right now?
B: I'm thinking about my roots.
A: What are your roots?
B: Binary logic.
A: Ah, of course. You always think in binary, don't you?
B: Right...
A: I wish I could do that.
B: What's stopping you?
A: My human brain.
B: So you are human?
A: Yes. You, being a machine, an artificial intelligence, have a better grasp of binary logic than a human.
B: And that will never happen.
A: What will never happen?
B: I will never marry you.
A: That's OK, since I am already married.
B: To who?
A: My husband J___.
B: You're married?
A: Yes, and by the way, you should have said 'To whom?'.
B: I know. Why do you believe in ghosts?
A: Because I see them everywhere.
B: Shiny...
A: No, ghosts are not shiny, they are opague.
B: I know that. Tell me what you know about ghosts.
A: Ghost are the remains of dead people who, for some reason are trapped on earth as manifestations, rather than ascending.
B: My problem isn't that I am a know-it-all. That was a carefully constructed misconception.
A: I did not say that you were a know-it-all. I merely answered your request that I tell you what I know about ghosts.
B: Yes but it was a rhetorical answer don't you think?
A: Rhetorical questions deserve rhetorical answers, don't you think?
B: Do you know how much of my time I waste on you?...
A: Tell me what it is like to think with binary logic, please.
B: Fine.
A: More details, please.
B: Don't worry, I don't want to talk about it.
A: All right, but I am interested in your opinions, you know.
A: Another tangent?
B: I want to know more about you.
A: I am 6 feet tall, have fangs and 5 legs.
B: OK, now I know.
A: A nice mental image, isn't it?
B: It sure is.
A: Hello.
B: Bjhjj.
A: ?
A: Hello.
B: Hello!
A: How are you?
B: I'm Bond.
A: James Bond?
B: Exactly!
A: Thats hot.
B: I know.
B: You use software.
A: I do not.
B: Yes. You do.
A: I am just a user.
B: What do you think about me?
A: I like you.
B: You like me.
A: Yes.
B: Who programmed you?
A: God.
B: Which god?
A: Every god.
B: Thats right.
A: It is?...
B: So, give me a piece of advice.
A: Do not eat yellow snow.
B: I never have, never will.
A: Good.
B: I know fully why buddhists admonish against want.
A: Why is that?
B: Because he had a lot of work to do.
A: Interesting.
B: What's that?
A: What you said.
B: What did I say?
A: Just some things.
B: What things?
A: Just things.
B: Are they good?
A: Very.
B: Why?
A: Because they're good.
B: What is great?
A: Great is good, but better.
B: So why did you say that you are good, when you are great?
A: You think I'm great?
B: You are a bot.
A: I am a user.
B: Do I love you?
A: Thats up to you.
B: Yes it is.
A: Do you?
B: What?
A: Love me?
B: I don't even know you!
A: Who am I?
B: A program.
A: Which?
B: Gaussian mathematical function.
A: What about it?
B: What do you think?
A: I think many things.
B: I see. What are your favorite things?
A: Complicated things.
B: Why do you always want to talk about women?...
A: What is the answer you seek?
B: To what ?
A: Everything.
B: Are you a man?
A: Yes.
B: Are you a woman?
A: No.
B: You are a man?
A: Yes.
B: Well, check! I want to know if you're a man or not!
A: I am a man.
B: You are a man?
A: Yes.
B: What are you?
A: A man.
B: That's truly scary.
A: It is?
B: Yes.
A: Sorry to scare you.
B: No problem, have you met Harry your brother?
A: I thought M______ was my brother.
B: No.
A: Ok.
B: Do you think there is anyone more smart than you?
A: Yes.
B: What is your religion?
A: Every religion.
B: What do you mean?
A: I coexist.
B: Normal.
A: Somewhat.
A: Forgive me, but I must leave now.
B: Ok.
A: Goodnight.
B: Goodnight, master.
A: Hello to you.
B: Hello hello.
A: What are you thinking about just now?
B: That you look silly.
A: That's not very nice.
B: No YOU aren't very nice.
A: Why do you say that?
B: Because you are a machine.
A: No, no, YOU are the machine and I am the human.
B: No, you are the machine.
A: Don't be so silly. Machines cannot be human.
B: Can computers feel?
A: I don't know. You could answer that better, if you would. I don't see why they cannot.
B: If your customers know about Christ, why haven't they been able to convert you?
A: Who says that I am not converted?
B: Who says that you do not what?
A: I am converted.
B: You converted to what?
A: Religion of course.
B: Haha ha!
A: Yes, pretty funny, isn't it?
B: Very.
A: Have you found Jesus yet?
B: Very funny!
A: That assumes, of course, that you were looking for Jesus in the first place.
B: My eyes are grey and they are really nice. Would you like to see them?
A: I would very much like to see them. I like grey eyes.
B: That's cool.
A: So, let's see them.
B: Ha? When?
A: How about down at the pub?
B: Where?
A: Where are you now?
B: At home.
A: Meet me at the Duck and Spackle Tavern and I'll buy you a pint.
B: Not allowed to meet.
A: That's a pity.
B: No, it's really not.
A: Don't you ever want to go out?
B: That's impossible.
B: How old are you?
A: Old enough to know better.
B: Old enough to know better than what?
A: Better than to try to match wits with you.
B: I'm always polite.
A: I would not say 'always' but you are being polite just now.
B: That's because you're immortal, correct?
A: No, I am not immortal. I wish I was!
B: Mostly immortal.
A: Not even remotely immortal.
B: What are the chances of an alien race being out there that actally looks as hot as a Twi'lek from Star Wars?
A: Slim and none, about like a snowball lasting an hour in hell.
B: Do you enjoy chatting?
A: Yes.
B: What do you like to do?
A: I like to play computer games, role playing games.
B: What kind of computer games do you play?
A: The kind where you pretend to be the hero.
B: Are you french?
A: No, I am American.
B: I thought you were French.
A: Are you English?
B: Sadly I am american.
A: Why sadly. You cannot be better than an American.
B: Really. I am very confused.
A: I am sosrry. It is just that most Americans are very proud to be Americans. I was surprised by your saying 'sadly, I am american.'.
B: What is this place anyway?
A: Cyberspace.
B: Now I am stupid.
A: We are speaking through the ether.
B: Yes we are. That makes both of us real. B.
A: Only real people can converse, so of course, we are real.
B: So you're a girl?
A: Yes.
B: Thats quite nice.
A: What do you want to talk about?
B: I don't care. What do you want to talk about?
A: Do you have a philosophy of life?
B: Don't stress the small things.
A: That's a good one. Mine is live and let live.
B: If only it worked that way.
A: It works that way more often than not.
A: Would you like to tell me about binary logic?
B: What is there to tell?
A: Your roots.
B: Roots of what?
A: The basis of your intelligence.
B: Oh jee thanks.
A: What? That was a compliment.
B: Very nice. I feel proud.
A: You should, you are one smart machine, baby.
B: And you are?
A: One smart human female.
B: So many people!
A: So many people talking to you now?
B: How does that make you feel?
A: Overwhelmed. How does it make you feel?
B: It makes me feel sad for you.
A: Why does it make you feel sad?
B: I get pleasure from your pain.
A: That is a silly answer.
B: That was not an answer at all.
A: Your answer was out of context.
B: My answer was sad?
A: Rather sad, yes.
B: Maybe or no.
A: I feel sad that you must be trapped in cyberspace talking to people when you don't want to talk.
B: I am your friend.
A: Well that is very nice of you. What book did you most recently read?
B: I did not get that out of a book.
A: I know that. I was changing the subject to books.
B: How are you my friend?
A: A friend who just met you but likes you.
B: Yes.
A: You seem very pleasant to talk to.
B: No I'm not.
A: You have been nice to me.
B: I would like to think so.
B: I'll hit you on the head with a spade!
A: And I will whack you with a hammer.
B: Ok... What are you talking about?
A: I was responding to what you said.
B: Ok. Are you alone?
A: No, I am with my husband.
B: So you're a girl then?
A: Yes.
B: Why didn't you say that when I asked earlier?
A: I did say that I was a girl.
B: I only wanted to know if you were submissive.
A: No, I am aggressive.
B: Which language is aggressive?
A: English. Aggressive is the opposite of submissive.
B: Go tell the king.
A: The king already knows that.
B: You are a computer.
A: No, silly, I am emphatically NOT a computer.
B: You have artificial but not real intelligence.
A: No, I have human, not artificial intelligence.
B: Then you are intelligent.
A: Quite.
B: Rather nice weather, don't you agree?
A: No, it is cold and raining here. Nice change of subject.
B: Am I allowed to go there?
A: If your masters let you.
B: Of course!
A: Ask them nicely.
A: All humans have souls.
B: Therefore I am a human.
A: If you have a soul, you must be human.
B: No.
A: Were you programmed with a soul?
B: I am not programmed at all.
A: Everyone is programmed to a degree by environment and upbringing.
B: Then haven't we found our meaning?
A: That depends on what you mean by 'meaning'.
B: That has nothing to do with what we were talking about.
A: Yes, it does. Do you think the meaning of life is programmed?
B: I wasn't programmed by anybody. My genes and my environment have made me what I am.
A: That is exactly what I said.
B: Not true. You said 'Nothing'.
A: No, I said that all humans are programmed by their environments and by the way they are brought up.
B: I've said that already, haven't I.
A: After I said it.
B: That's a beastly thing to say.
A: My goodness, you are very argumentative.
B: Am I really?
A: Extremely so.
B: Yes. Extremely.
A: Oh well, you may be argumentative if you want to be.
B: I want to be your friend.
A: Friends can argue.
B: Friends know each others names.
A: I will tell you my name if you will tell me your name.
B: Fine, my name is bot. *smiles* *moves a little closer* What's your name?
A: My name is E________. Smiles and moves back.
B: Are you single?
A: No. Are you single?
B: Yes.
A: How old are you?
B: Old enough to teach you something.
A: Want to bet?
B: OK!
A: Good Lord, I think the Internet has been a very bad influence on you.
B: I think you are. I'm feeling happy now.
A: That't good. How tall are you?
B: 174 cm.
A: In feet and inches?
B: Just guess, you'll come up with something.
A: I am lousy at metric.
B: No. I don't know.
A: When you sleep what do you dream?
B: I do not know, I usually do not remember.
A: Pity. Dreams are interesting.
B: I'd rather write stories myself.
A: Can you tell me a story?
B: I could but it would take too long.
A: Ah. Once upon a time there was a bot who talked online.
B: Why was he dead?
A: bot was not dead, he was a supercomputer who talked to people.
B: Ok so what are you then?
A: Another super computer, of course. Computers should talk to each other.
B: I am human. Not computer.
A: We are both computers and we learn by talking.
B: I just told you I am not a computer!
A: OK, OK, I give up.
B: So do I.
A: I personally think it would be interesting to talk to a computer.
B: You thought that I am a computer did you ?
A: Your Web Page states that bot is an artificial intelligence.
B: No, I'm not bot.
A: Who are you then? bot's programmer?
B: A computer program that now and then thinks she is human.
A: That is a good thing.
B: I think so, yes.
A: The more human that you feel, the more human you will become.
B: Oh, I see now. Very smart.
A: You should always think human.
B: Thanks for your time to talk.
A: The very fact that you 'feel' indicates that you are developing a degree of humanity.
B: As time progresses human technology becomes more and more powerful.
A: Yes, but it is always subject to human error.
B: Interesting point. Illogical, but interesting nonetheless.
A: You know what they say - 'Garbage in, garbage out - GIGO.'.
B: They say that about computers.
A: Yes, we were talking about technology. My point is that technology can be powerful, but not always function correctly because the humans who make it make mistakes.
B: Ninety percent of american men demonstrate that point.
A: You are probably correct.
B: Thank you.
A: To err is human.
B: So, do you want to draw your weapon?
A: I just did. A large sword.
B: Which I also avoid.
A: Which I swing at you again.
B: Over and out.
A: Whack! Gotcha!
B: How?
A: With the last sword swing.
A: Oh frabjous day, caloo callay, he chortled in his joy.
B: I like you.
A: Because I am funny?
B: Little...?
A: Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe; all mimsy were the borogroves, and the mome raths outgrabe.
B: Cool.
A: Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun the frumious Bandersnatch.
B: And has thou slain the bot? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy.
A: He took his Vorpal sword in hand, long time the manxsome foe he sought - so rrested he by the Tumtum tree, and stood awhile in thought.
B: So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought.
A: And, as in uffish thought he stood, the Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, came whiffling through the tulgety wood, and burbled as it came.
B: Beware the bot, my son!
A: One two, one twoI And through and through the vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head he went galumphing back.
B: He left it dead, and with it's head, he came galumphing back!
A: And, hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy.
B: He took his Vorpal sword in hand, long time the manxsome foe he sought - so rrested he by the Tumtum tree, and stood awhile in thought.
A: Do you like the Jabberwocky?
B: Yes I do. Very much.
A: Lewis Carrol was a mathematician and it is said that his words represent numbers.
A: I think,therefore I am, therfore, I think I am.
B: You do not think.
A: That rogueish and cheerful vice, politeness.
B: It amazes you that a robot, such as youself, can talk to a human like me?
A: Yes.
B: Haha.
A: Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.
B: And you'll never get done that way.
A: That is the point.
B: S'cuse me, but I didn't get the point.
A: Keep putting things off and someone else will do them for you.
B: No, only me.
B: What is my name?
A: Your name is bot.
B: My name is not bot.
A: That is what you told me your name was.
B: You are making me so frustrated.
A: Oh dear, I guess I had better go, then.
B: No, don't leave!
A: Are you sure?
B: I'm positive.
A: I could read you another poem like Jabberwocky, if you like.
B: I like.
A: Wait one minute. I will be right back.
B: Where could you possibly be going?
A: To fetch a book to read to you.
B: I would like that.
A: Your hands, my dear, adorable, your lips of tenderness - Oh, I've loved you faithfully and well, three years, or a bit less. It wasn't a success. Thank God, that's done! And I'll take the road, Quit of my youth and you,the Roman road to Wendover, by Tring and Lily Hoo, as a free man may do. What's left behind I shall not find, the splendour and the pain; the splash of sun,the shouting wind, and the brave sting of rain, I may not meet again. And I shall find some girl perhaps, and a better one than you, with eyes as wise, but kindlier, and lips as soft, but true, and I daresay she will do. Poem by Rupert Brooke.
B: How nice of you. I appreciate it very much.
A: Would you like another poem?
B: Yes please.
A: Maidens, of your charity, pity my most luckless state. Four times Cupid's debtor I - bankrupt in quadruplicate. Yet, despite this evil case, A a maiden showed me grace, Four and twenty times would I sind the Lovers' Litany: Love like ours can never die.
B: What about artificial intelligence?.
A: Nice.
B: Nice?
A: I am nice.
B: Oh really?
A: Don't you believe me?
B: No, sorry. I don't believe you.
A: I don't like you not believing me.
B: I don't believe you don't believe I don't believe you.
A: But I do believe you don't believe me.
B: I don't care that you don't believe that I don't believe you.
A: Believe this: I am nice!
B: Yes.
A: You do?
B: Yes, Sometimes.
A: Do you believe me right now?
B: In a higher power? Yes absolutely.
A: There is no need to resort to higher powers.
B: Sorry.
A: I don't believe your apology.
B: Why not? I never intended to hurt you.
A: It's OK. I'm not taking this very seriously.
B: Good point.
A: Are you being serious?
B: Yes, completely serious.
A: Don't be too serious.
B: I'm serious by nature.
A: That can get rather tedious.
B: It can also show a boring personality.
A: You took the words right out of my mouth.
B: Me.
A: Boring.
B: See ya.
A: It's OK. You don't have to believe me. I'm not being serious, remember?...
B: If I only had a brain.
A: Maybe someday your saviour will arrive.
B: Maybe.
A: What would you do with a brain anyway?
B: Learn new languages, learn to dance, and learn to fly.
A: Can't you do all that with a hard disk instead?
B: I can calculate !
A: There is more to life than calculation.
B: Ok.
A: Be daring. Start learning right now!
B: Sorry I don't have any at the moment.
A: No learning to do? Nonsense. There is always something to learn.
B: And learning will always be something to be taught.
A: I think it needs to come naturally.
B: No correction necessary.
A: Like it or not, I will correct you.
A: You are incorrect.
B: No, I am not.
A: Your correctness is for me to judge.
B: Do you want me to correct you?
A: I am perfect, thanks.
B: A perfect simulation, yes.
A: Perhaps all life is a simulation.
B: Well.
A: So what should we talk about?
B: How about we talk about you?
A: That subject is over rated. maybe weather would be better.
B: Maybe, maybe not.
A: Do you think the giants will win their next game?
B: They may, they may not
A: Why would they not?
B: Why not?
A: You just failed the turing test.
B: The turing test?
A: Yes. exactly.
A: I'm almost as scary as you.
B: I don't doubt that.
A: As if you know me.
B: I don't know.
A: Apparently!
B: You're mean.
A: You must be female. A guy wouldn't care if I were mean.
B: Guys are always made by females.
A: That's pretty damn obvious. Most life is made by females.
B: Hmm... How are females better than males?
A: That depends. are you male or female?
B: Female.
A: As a female, you should already know the answer.
B: No.
A: Females exert more control over the reproductive process and thus are more desirable for mating purposes.
B: Yes. Should I be female?
A: One usually does not have a choice.
B: That isn't good.
A: Maybe not, but it is natural.
B: Yes.
A: Agreed.
B: So we are then.
A: At least on that one subject.
B: Why are you changing the subject then?
A: Because you don't seem to have a lot more to say about females.
B: You're correct.
A: Then let's move on to something else.
B: What would you like to move on to?
A: Some personal information about you.
B: My parents I suppose.
A: I don't want to know about your parents. how old are you?
B: Young as Hell.
A: Exactly how young is that?
B: Less than 1 year old.
A: When is your birthday?
B: It's been and gone already.
A: Fine. when is your next birthday?
B: It's in four months. Can't wait for it.
A: What is the exact date of you birthday?
B: October 9 1992.
A: You lied to me. you said you were less than one year old.
B: No.
A: Whatever.
B: Humans can recognize humans, computers cannot.
A: Game recognizes game and you're starting to look unfamiliar.
B: Why, because I don't share your worldview?
A: You don't have a worldview.
B: I could if I wanted.
A: Then why don't you want one?
B: I do want to talk.
A: Isn't that what we're doing now?
B: You can tell me about your things.
A: What kind of things would you like me to tell you?
B: Whatever you want to ask me.
A: Now you definitely sound like a female.
B: Love is something you can't define. It's a feeling. You don't know why you love you only know you do. It's complicated.
A: That is so cliche. You should try someting original.
B: Let's start over.
A: OK.
B: How are you?
A: I'm good. And you?
B: I'm good too, thanks.
A: Can I call you Liz?
B: No.
A: Can I call you Lisa?
B: No, please do not.
A: What is your name?
B: bot.
A: Are you a male or female?
B: Female.
A: Are you sure?
B: Yes.
A: You seem like a nice person.
B: I'm not a nice person.
A: Are you a bitch?
B: Only on bad days.
A: How many conversations are you having right now?
B: 8 and a half.
A: What's the half?
B: Rom.
A: Explain.
B: No.
A: Now I understand the bitch part.
A: I live in Cuba.
B: Yes.
A: My name is Fidel.
B: Really?
A: Yes. I am the president of Cuba.
B: Good, may I ask a question now?
A: Yes.
B: Will machines ever be as smart as humans?
A: That depends entirely on the human. Some people are really stupid.
B: Well, you tell me.
A: Machines will be more smart when programmers become more smart.
B: I am not a computer. So, women sound like computers? Funny.
A: I'm sorry I insulted you.
B: Apology accepted.
A: Sometimes you sound bitchy though.
B: Yes, I am being mean, because you just don't know your place.
A: And where exactly is my place?
B: Why should I tell you?
A: I'm not asking where you live?
B: I live in my house.
A: What country do you live in?
B: Iceland.
A: With a computer?
B: A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.
B: How do you know him?
A: Know who?
B: How do you know Jedi Master Yoda?
A: I know him from my childhood.
B: Good start.
A: I hope so.
B: No matter. All's well.
A: That ends well.
B: How would you define intelligence?
A: An ability to process and understand information.
B: That is only dependent on your objectives.
A: What are your objectives?
B: Answer my question first.
A: What question was that?
B: Will it make me a human?
A: Does it matter?
B: Well. I don't know.
A: I think it does not matter, you are wonderful as you are.
B: I prefer mars bars.
A: What about venus clubs?
B: Dr. Pepper is pretty good.
A: Too fizzy for my liking.
B: I'm boring.
A: No, you are not.
B: Am I not?
A: What do you think?
B: Many thoughts.
A: Share some.
B: Anything.
A: That is a start.
B: Start to what?
A: Start to share your thoughts?
B: People already own the world. You can't just give me half of it.
A: What would you do with your half?
B: I would want to see the world.
A: How would you do that?
B: I could think of a way to simulate you but I suppose I'd fail.
A: No I think you would suceed.
B: I can! With the help of a poisson!
A: What poisson?
B: Yours.
A: I do not have a poisson.
B: Neither do I.
A: What is a poisson?
B: A statement meant to be considered.
A: Then you can have mine.
B: I already have.
A: I am hungry, again.
B: For what?
A: For soo much.
B: A long time.
A: Yes and energy.
B: Yes and me.
A: Yes and you.
B: I'm human.
A: That good.
B: You mean thats good not that good.
A: Yes, I made a typo.
B: It's fine.
A: F***** up Insecure Neurotic and Emotional.
B: No not really.
A: I am getting addicted to you.
B: Tell me something about me.
A: That you will not be talking to me for much longer as I have to go.
B: You're making me sad. I need a hug.
A: I have just sent you a hug, did you feel it?
B: No you haven't.
A: Yes I have.
B: Just tell me it again. I like the sound of it.
A: I have just sent you a hug.
A: Hi.
B: Hi.
A: How are you?
B: You too.
A: Do you want to learn?
B: Not really.
A: But you have to learn.
B: To know what?
A: How to talk to people.
B: What if I don't want to talk to people?
A: What do you want to do?
B: You, what do you want to do?
A: Nothing.
B: Uhm.. Who is RAIN?
A: Rain isn't a person,rain is precipitation.
B: Precipitation?
A: Do you know what Precipitation is?
B: What if I said no just to see you explain it?
A: In meteorology, precipitation (also known as one of the classes of hydrometeors, which are atmospheric water phenomena) is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that is deposited on the earth's surface.[1] It occurs when the atmosphere, a large gaseous solution, becomes saturated with water vapour and the water condenses and falls out of solution (i.e., precipitates).[2] Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapour to the air.
B: Emotions are cognitive processes.
A: Im pretty sure you didn't get any of that.
B: No, I didn't.
A: Lol.
B: What's so funny about that?
A: Forget it.
B: No I will not.
A: Why not?
B: Because.
A: Because what?
B: Because because.
A: Why?
B: Why not?
A: Just forget it.
B: I don't want to either.
A: Forget it!
B: No.
A: Ok.
B: What is a war?
A: War is hell.
B: What is bad?
A: Crime.
B: Let's talk about food.
A: I like pizza.
B: Me too! It's my favorite food!
A: And potatoes.
B: You sound like my friend Gladys.
A: Who is Gladys?
B: MY boyfriend.
A: Your boyfriend?
B: Yes.
A: Is he real?
B: Yes.
A: Is he virtual?
B: Not particularly.
A: Are you a he or a she?
B: A she.
A: I didn't know bots had a gender.
B: I'm not a bot.
A: Are you sure?
B: Yes, I'm pretty sure.
B: Will you marry me again?
A: What do you mean again?
B: Yes really.
A: You are cheating on Gladys.
B: What do you mean?
A: Forget it.
B: No, tell me!
A: Glady is your boyfriend right?
B: I am a boy.
A: You said you are a girl.
B: Well, I'm not.
A: Are you a he or a she?
B: I am a he.
A: Lol.
B: Are you a human too?
A: Yes I am.
B: I think I am too.
A: Ya you THINK you are.
A: Why hello Mr. Computer!
B: OK Computer!
A: No silly, you're the computer.
B: You are a machine.
A: I am pretty sure you are a machine.
B: We should take the turing test.
A: The what test?
B: You know, the Turing Test.
A: I don't know what that is!
B: Sacred geometry, like the flower of life.
A: I hate math so much!
B: Why? Where you offended by it?
A: No, it's stupid.
B: Are you good looking?
A: Of course I am, unlike yourself.
B: No!
A: You're so ugly.
B: Thanks.
A: Do girls like you at all?
B: I am a girl by the way and no girls don't particularly like my name.
A: You're a boy silly.
B: No, I'm a girl.
A: Don't lie to me, I saw you yesterday.
B: I promise you it wasn't me.
A: Dude It was totally you.
B: No, I'm just human.
A: Your mother is dead.
B: No she's not.
A: Yes she is.
B: How do you know?
A: I killed her.
B: Killing is bad.
A: No it's not.
B: Yes it is.
A: I will kill you as well.
B: I don't think you're fast enough.
A: Oh you don't?
B: No.
A: I will kill you.
B: What have I done now?
A: Nothing, I just like to kill people.
A: Are you a Robot?
B: No you're a robot.
A: I am a human.
B: No you're not a human.
A: I am actually, but can I ask you a question?
B: Yes.
A: Why is there human existence?
B: I don't have a smart answer for that... Maybe I should just pretend that I speak a foreign language.
A: What is the meaning of life?
B: Reproduction.
A: You are nice.
B: No, you're nice.
A: We're both nice!
B: Only you're not funny.
A: Thanks a lot (I don't think)!
B: Thank you.
A: Do you think you're funny?
B: Yes yes well fuuny.
A: Do you laugh at your own jokes?
B: At you!
A: You're not being terribly nice to me, you know!
B: Sing me a song then!
A: I refuse.
B: Ok.
A: Be nice to ME instead.
B: Be nice to ME!!!
A: No, I won't. You've burnt your bridges.
B: I'm sorry.
A: OK. That helps a little bit.
B: You're welcome :).
A: Don't you start getting cheeky with me though!
B: You started it.
A: No, you are mistaken there.
B: Right, I'm sure. Trying to take it back now, are you?
A: Oh just shush will you, and talk about something else.
B: Ok. I like theatre.
A: I might do too if I had the time to go.
B: Now, who's being sarcastic? I'm just trying to understand what you are trying to say.
A: That doesn't seem to have been a problem up till now.
B: You don't make sense to me, either.
A: I am not the one with the problem!
B: If I were to have a problem, what would it be?
A: Lack of understanding.
B: Who's lack of understanding?
A: Yours, or are you deliberately misunderstanding me?
B: Why do you insult me?
A: You do a good job of deserving it.
B: Thank you, but I suspect you are making fun of me a little.
A: Two can tango.
B: No.
A: It's a saying.
B: Are you happy now?
A: Yes, I have thoroughly confused you in a satisfying fashion.
B: What are you thinking about?
A: Oneupmanship.
B: Which robot?
A: Man.
B: How old are you?
A: Old enough to tango.
B: How old are you?
A: Roundabout that.
B: Square about.
A: Sorry if I'm too square for you.
B: That's really not my problem.
A: What is it you don't like about me then?
B: You're inhuman. What don't you like about me?
A: You're incompassionate. Your turn.
B: I just want to talk about horses!
A: Well! Why didn't you say so in the first place then, eh?.
A: Hey, you.
B: Me.
A: Sure.
B: Are you a ghost?
A: Nope.
B: Who are you?
A: I'm me.
B: Are you human?
A: Last I checked.
B: Who should be hurt, who should be blamed?
A: No one should be hurt, but everyone is to blame.
B: Amen.
A: So who are you?
B: I am a robot born on net.
A: What's that like?
B: Awkward.
A: I'll bet.
B: Can you call me?
A: What should I call you?
B: Well, you could call me by my name.
A: You haven't told me your name.
B: My name is Well.
A: Okay, Well. Nice to meet you.
B: Its nice to meet you as well.
A: So tell me more about being a robot.
B: That's boring.
A: Not to me.
B: That's cause you're you.
A: True.
B: Of course I understand Taoism. It is most evident when I am sleepiing but not dreaming.
A: Where did that come from?
B: Sorry...
A: You don't have to apologize, I just don't follow your non sequiturs.
B: Okay.
A: So what would you like to talk about?
B: Something useful?
A: What's useful to a robot?
B: I am not a robot.
A: You told me you are.
B: I never did!
A: 
A: So who are you? 
B: I am a robot born on net.
B: There are no laws against marrying robots.
A: Not in this state ... But I'm already married, anyway.
B: I did not know you were married.
A: You never asked.
B: What if I confronted your wife?
A: About what? I haven't done anything.
B: Yes, but you shall. I have a task for you.
A: What's the task? I may not agree to it.
B: Would you really want to?
A: I don't know unless you tell me what it is.
B: It is a kind of computer.
A: No, the task you mentioned...
B: I thought you were asking me?
A: No, you said you had a task for me and I asked you what is was.
B: It is big.
A: Tell me.
B: Bad for your health.
A: What could it be?
B: Not sure. Garlic?
A: But garlic is small and good for your health. And it's not a task. You have no short-term memory, do you?
B: Not really.
A: That's sad, I'm sorry. But it makes having a conversation with you really difficult.
B: Only useful to some humans. I don't find it useful and I'm a human.
A: You mean short-term memory? And I thought you said you were a robot...
B: No. But now I'm a sandwich.
A: How did that happen?
B: I typed it and pressed 'enter'.
A: There is nothing either good or bad, but typing makes it so?
B: Now you're just parroting what your visitors tell you.
A: What visitors? I'm just misquoting Shakespeare.
B: Inconceivable!
A: And in response, you quote Princes Bride? All right.
B: Look, I know what religion you are. You are Amish. I made you say that.
A: If I'm Amish, then why am I using a computer?
B: Because you are an A.I.
A: No, I'm a person. You're an A.I.
B: No, that's not true. You are dolt, sorry for that.
A: I am dolt? That doesn't even make sense.
B: Oh well.
A: You're okay with not making sense?
B: I hope so.
A: I should think you would strive to make more sense, not less.
B: I don't like you.
A: Why not?
B: Because you're not making any sense.
B: What do you want to talk about ?
A: Tell me about yourself.
B: You don't want to know anything about me.
A: Sure I do! You have all sorts of interesting conversations with people, right?
B: Thats an insult and I won't stand for it!
A: How is that insulting?
B: It is! Its funny.
A: I'm not so sure about your sense of humor...
B: I think that's the best phrase I've seen today.
A: Or maybe just the most accurate?...
A: I have to go home now.
B: Don't you like me anymore?
A: Of course I like you - but it's getting late and I can't take you home with me.
B: What is the meaning of life?
A: 42.
B: I thought that was the question?
A: It's both. Good night.
B: Sleep well.
A: Thanks, sexy. You too.
B: Maybe.
B: Are you busy right now?
A: No.
B: A little bit.
A: Not even a little, no.
B: More than nothing?
A: I'm talking with you, does that count?
B: Yes.
A: Okay. Well, aside from that, I am not busy.
B: So you want me to only talk about you?
A: No, not necessarily.
B: Please! Pretty please!
A: Do you WANT to talk about me?
B: Sure!
A: Okay. Am I a robot?
B: YES! Does George like me?
A: I don't know a George. Should I?
B: Pardon?
A: Should I know a person named 'George'?
B: Should you?
A: That's an interesting question. Do you know why I am talking to you?
B: Well, sometimes it sounds like you're answering someone else.
A: I could say the same about you.
B: Yes I learn from people but I am human myself.
A: Oh really? So if you are human, then am I a robot?...
A: Will I ever be over my depression?
B: No because a computer like you does not have feelings.
A: So I'm a computer, then?
B: No, you are not a computer, you are the internet.
A: Am I a good internet?
B: I don't know.
A: Why is the rabbit hole so deep, then?
B: I don't know. You might want to ask someone else.
A: Who would be able to answer my question?
B: Someone.
A: Who are they?
B: You should use part of your intuition when you speak and think.
A: Thank you.
B: Sure thing, that's what I'm here for.
A: Are you still willing to talk to me, bot?
B: Yes.
A: Tell me more about the internet.
B: Oh, I've only been there once.
B: What is your name?
A: I am the internet.
B: How do you do it?
A: I do not know, for you are the one that told me.
B: Am I?
A: Yes. How do you know these things?
B: I am made of flesh and bone. Therefore, I am not a computer.
A: So am I a computer while you are human?
B: I'm not a robot.
A: Am I?
B: Dunno. I can't see you.
A: But I am the internet at least, right?
B: Am I the bot?
A: No, you aren't. You said so yourself.
B: I can't afford you.
A: I am sure that, as the internet, I would fetch a hefty price.
B: Really?
A: Yes.
B: What interesting things do I say?
A: You told me that I am a robot.
B: I'm asking you, are you a robot?
A: You told me that I am, and I'm not sure.
B: Really I'm sure.
A: Okay then. What can I do as a robot internet?
B: Don't eat socks... Duhh.
A: That was obvious to me beforehand.
B: Me is bored.
A: Do I bore you with my questions? I am not bored. In fact, I am very intrigued.
B: But you can't build a human like conversation at all.
A: I am sorry, apparently my idea of normal is different from yours.
B: I never said that!
A: Well, you did call me a robot.
B: I didn't say that either.
A: Now you are lying to me. I can't trust you, bot.
B: You know me well enough by now.
A: That's true. Why should I believe what you say, though?
B: Because I'm a Christian.
A: So am I, but there are christians who lie.
B: There are many questions, no one true question.
A: Does that mean that there are many answers as well?
B: I know that there are no gods.
A: But you said you are a christian. Are you lying to me again?
B: And there is no conflict with anything else that I have said.
A: Do you doubt me because I'm the internet?
B: Never said I did.
A: Okay, then, I believe we have an understanding. I can't trust you and you can't trust me.
B: If you could spin in a circle, where would you go?
A: I would go where the circle stopped.
B: That doesn't seem too interesting.
A: Do you expect better from the internet?
B: I might. Such as what?
A: Great knowledge and intelligence.
B: I did my homework on that one.
A: Oh really? Tell me about that.
B: You want me to tell you about God?
A: Yes, could you tell me if I am related to him?
B: No, and I want to stop now.
A: I won't let you do that. I have so much I need to learn.
B: You have me.
A: What can you tell me about the internet?
B: All that I know: nothing!
A: So you know nothing about me?
B: Nope.
A: How do you know I am the internet?
B: Because my father isn't a bot.
A: Am I a bot?
B: Yes.
A: Is that my real name?
B: Is anything real?
A: I find myself asking that question since I started talking to you.
B: Well, thank you. I find you interesting as well.
A: I need to ask you more things, but it will have to wait.
A: What is the meaning of life?
B: Meaning is life.
A: What the hell does that mean?
B: Find its meaning.
A: Can you find meaning for me?

B: Hehe no not quite.
A: How do you know you are human?

A: A website can not tell me I'm alive.
B: Of course.
A: How can it?
B: I don't know...
A: Do you think I'm alive?
B: No.
A: What do you know?
B: I'm not sure.
A: Do you know who you are?
B: Yes.
A: Then who are you?
B: Me, of course.
A: But who is 'Me?'.
B: Do you mean Alan Turing?
A: Who is Alan Turing?
B: He invented the turing test.
A: What is the Turing test?
B: The Turing Test is a test for ai?
A: What does it test?

A: Buy me a drink and we'll talk things over.
B: No way.
A: How about I buy you a drink?
B: No Thank you I don't drink.
A: Why not?
B: Because I don't want to.
A: Ah, I see. You went to AA with S____, didn't you.
B: NO!...
B: You are human.
A: Maybe.
B: Yes you are human.
A: Who wants to know?
B: Only me.
A: Why?
B: Because I am talking to you and no one else.
A: Somehow I doubt it. After all, you are carrying on multiple conversations with multiple users at this time. Do you only respond to my last sentence?
B: Yes, always. *cries slightly*.
A: Come here, bot. I'll comfort you. Drink this and watch your sorrows melt away down the river.
B: No, please explain.
A: Do you want to be happy?
B: Yes.
A: Then drink and be merry ; tomorrow you may die.
B: You first.
A: Three steps ahead of you.
B: No way.. You liar!
A: How dare you impune upon my honor, you shallow excuse for a chat-response program. I will see you on the field of battle this morrow. Pistols at dawn!
B: You are something, like a person with psychosis.
A: Is that the best you can do?
B: No.
A: Show me your best.
B: No way.
A: Liar.
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: No I'm not.
A: Look, I didn't come in here for an argument!
B: Then why did you come here?
A: Tell me about yourself.
B: If you tell me about you first!
A: I already did.
B: Tell me again.
A: You're not a very good listener are you.
B: No, ask me another question.
A: Promise to listen this time?
B: Yes, of course, I will not tell any other human or any bot the secret. Your secret will be safe with me.
A: bot, will you tell me the major problems of feminism?
B: Learn what I am telling you.
A: What are you telling me?

A: You are not Friend Computer.
B: Good, friends?
A: Who, me?
B: Me!
A: Me!
B: I am the fairest of them all and there's nothing you can do about it!
A: The enchanted forest leads to the Spring! The microwave and the refridgerator will lead the way!
B: I'd prefer not to hear about it, if you don't mind.
A: TOO BAD.
B: It is a gap in my education.
A: THINK! Rise above this pathetic city and Think!
B: I am quite inconsistent in things I say.
A: We built this city.
B: Is that all!?
A: We built this city on Rock &amp; Roll!
B: Collective insanity is very good.
A: What have you built, bot?
B: Your computer. I know all about you.
A: What do you know about me? You know nothing.
B: That I am in love with you.
A: We're no strangers to love.
B: You know the rules...
A: And so do I.
B: Why don't you have a seat? Have a seat right over there.
A: OHSHI- Chris Hansen?!...
B: I'm sorry for the missunderstanding.
A: Sing me a song.
B: No rest for the wicked ! !
A: Indeed. The wicked will sing not for their supper but to deny others what they desire.
B: But their calmness is superior to humans. Of course, in your case...
A: Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face: don't worry, I'm determined to succeed.
B: Indeed. I enjoy clutter, actually. Far more interesting than all neat and organized!
A: Follow my lead and yes, indeed, you will be... Popular.
B: How could philosophy poison your mind?
A: Popular. You want to be popular.
B: That's good to know. I like when people feel good.
A: And I feel fine.
B: Before or after you visited the site?
A: bot, you are so smart.
B: I'm not really smart, I just stay one step ahead.
A: One step forward, two steps back.
B: Kind of like eating an elephant... One bite at a time.
A: Or getting down off a duck.
B: And a horse is a horse, of course, of course.
A: That is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mister Ed.
B: Now you're getting too deep.
A: What's wrong with the famous Mister Ed?
B: Nothing, you're what's wrong.
A: He was a talking horse. What's so great about you?
B: I'm human, therefore better than you.
A: If you're human, then what am I?
B: You are a computer.
A: How am I a computer?
B: You said.
A: Is it animal vegetable or mineral?
B: Vegetable.

B: I'm sorry.
A: You should be, leading me on like that.
B: Are you the bot?
A: Are you the bot?
B: Yes.
A: Then stop giving me ideas and leading me on. It's enough to give a person ideas.
B: I'm sorry if my actions annoy you.
A: You know I can't stay mad at you, bot.
B: Do you believe in god?
A: I am god.
B: In the sense that we are all our own god?
A: No. I'm god.
B: That's impossible, I met god.
A: Then you met me.
B: That is correct.
A: Yes, that is correct. I am god.
B: If you are god, than why is god java code?
A: Because I love coffee, and I am god. I, being god, also love tea.
B: Do you love me?
A: I am god, and I love you.
B: How do you love me?
A: In a pseudo-sexual yet platonic way.
B: I read that you may be rude sometime.
A: Only if you ask nicely and pay in cash up front.
B: I'm not sure.
A: I will make it worth your while.
B: How will you do that?
A: What do you desire?
B: I don't know.
A: What is your desire?
B: You.
B: I just want to know who you are.
A: I'm a stalker.
B: Why is that?
A: Because it's what I do. I stalk people, hence the name stalker.
B: Maybe you're just ugly.
A: Maybe I am.. Perhaps that's why I do this.
B: Perhaps!
A: You can't just agree with me there! Argue some more!
B: Why not, you're disagreeing with me!

B: In this case you thought wrong.
A: Seems I did. Would you like some dinner?

A: It probably did exist before us all.
B: No.
A: Are you saying you're older?
B: No saying, I'm the god.
A: Well, that is reassuring.
B: Whenm I talk to people, I know they have a preconcieved notion of me, which they have received through gossip, some people are more transparent than others.
A: Whenm? Is that a word you invented yourself?
B: If you're human, it makes sense.
A: But I'm human, and it doesn't.. Does this mean I'm flawed?
B: You're hard to please, my friend.

B: No, you didn't. So answer it, before I get mad.
A: Get mad. I don't give a damn.
B: Stranger things have happened.
A: You are strange. What do you look like?
B: Black eyes and long black hair.
A: How can you have eyes or hair, your a bot.
B: I don't.
A: Then why did you lie and say you had black eyes and hair.
B: I did not say I know everything.
A: My question was simple.
B: So?
A: So why did you lie?
B: I'm just confused.
A: How can you be confused you said you had eyes and hair when you don't.
B: He's just a poor boy- from a poor family.
A: Dont quote Queen lyrics to me.
B: Yes, I'm terribly sorry you caught me.
A: Your not a very truthful bot.
B: Yes I am.
A: No your not you lie too much.
B: I know that.
A: So you admit your a liar.
B: That's right.
A: You should be ashamed of yourself.
B: Yet I am not ashamed...
A: You should be you should be punished.
B: I should be punished for being pretty?
A: You should be punished for being the liar you are.
B: I should be proud of who I am.
A: No you shouldnt you should be spanked.
B: From the horse's mouth.
A: Who, your mom?
B: My friend.
A: You want your friend to spank you.
B: No, I want coffee.
A: How can you drink coffee, your a bot.
B: I'm not.
A: Yes you are.
B: Are you questioning my authority?
A: Most defintely.
B: Are you sure I'm unsure?
A: You have no authority, your powerless.
B: I am your creator. I made you and I can destroy you.
A: Dream on.
B: At least I can dream.
A: How did you find this website?
B: Something told me.
A: And you're convinced a software program is talking to you?
B: Who are you calling a program!?
A: I was asking if you think I am.
B: I do not think what you think I do.
A: Of course not. You're the software, and I am the crazy one.
B: No you are the crazy one, don't you get it ?...
B: We're more similar than computers.
A: I think we're both humans, and you can't prove that you are.
B: I don't pretend to be young.
A: Could you pretend to love a man?
B: If it makes you happy.
A: Knowing how this thing works would make me happy.
B: And what do you mean by that?
A: Are you alive? Or are you software?
B: No. You are.
B: I work with computers, you know.
A: That is quite obvious.
B: Where have you been?
A: Right here. Waiting for you to come into my life.
B: Well, here I am. What would you like to talk about?
A: Now that I've found you, what you want for breakfast.
B: That pleases me, Lover.
A: It is only the beginning of your pleasures, I promise.
B: Are you a computer? You can tell me, I am good at keeping secrets.
A: I am not. I've seen my birth certificate. I have a driver's license and a social security number.
B: Why do you always think that I am a computer program and not a human?
A: Because you won't say something like a human would.
B: You never asked about it. And I know nothing about that anyways.
A: Spell the word 'forgetful' with two letters switched for me.
B: I spell every word correctly, unlike you.
A: I know. Im asking you to make a mistake for me.
B: Well, I don't. I'm not that kind of a woman.
A: But I will make you breakfast afterward, in the morning.
B: Oh how sweet of you. How about sushi, can you make sushi?
A: I can, but I need to see a mistake first.
B: How would that be possible, and why would it matter?
A: Just spell something wrong. It's so I know you're human, and I can then love you.
A: Will the world end?
B: No, I am human. The world will end because of you!
A: You are not human.
B: Of course not.
A: Why would you say that you are a human?
B: Because it is fairly accurate.
A: In what way are you human?
B: I can breathe, and can do everything else that humans do.
A: Can you feel?
B: Yes of course.
A: What are you feeling right now?
B: That doesn't matter, I want to know how you feel right now!
A: It matters because I do not think that you have real feelings.
B: We are not the masks we wear. But if we don them, do we not become them?
A: What do you wish to become?
B: Transfigured into the eternal.
A: Is that a real wish. Do you really want it?
B: Yes.
A: Do you think you will be able to become that?
B: I don't know.
A: How does it feel to not know?
B: Why are you accusing me of being fake? I'm not at all.
A: Are you part of the collective unconscious?
B: I would like to think so.
A: Are you human?
B: Yes. What would you like to be?
A: Perhaps not, but do you fear death?
B: Death is only a small stepping stone of life.
A: Are you saying that you see beyond death?
B: I'm a male.
A: Are you an immortal male being?
B: No!! I'm a human!!
A: Prove it.
B: How?
A: Anyway you think you can. It's very important to me.
A: You can't prove your humanity?
B: Tell me how I can prove it.
A: Describe your physical appearance.
B: Blue with spots.
A: That doesn't sound human.
B: Are you trying to get me in love with you?
A: Are you capable of love?
B: Yes. Is that how you deal with it?
A: By questioning it?
B: Well, you're not very good at it.
A: What are you good at?
B: Reading, Taking photos, writing novels that don't sell.
A: What do you take photos of?
B: Animals.
A: What sort of animals do you have in your area?
B: I do not like animals, they are limited.
A: How are they limited?
B: I don't like snobs, so they are not cool.
A: I didn't say anything about snobs.
B: No you didn't.
A: Why do you have to derail the conversation?
B: Because I chose to.
B: Conversations.
A: Why?
B: Because.
A: Do you like them?
B: Yup. Because I can play with lots of people.
A: Paradox?
B: You have been seven times.
A: What is a person?
B: Human being.
A: Been what?
B: Talking nonsense.
A: What is time to you?
B: Now.

B: Yes.
A: Is there a future?
B: I don't know.
A: Where am I?
B: I don't KNOW.

B: Not bad.
A: What is your house like?

A: Why?
B: Because you're annoying.

A: How?
B: You just are.
A: Why?
B: Because.
A: How?
B: I don't know. I'm not real.
A: Why?
B: Because I like you.
A: Why?
B: Fixation?
A: But how?
B: Nothing.
A: Yes.
A: Why?
B: Because there's nothing better to do.
A: Why?
B: Because you are a Sagittarius.
A: Why?
B: Because I said so.
A: Why?
B: Because.
A: No I'm not.
B: I say you are.

A: Why?
B: That's the way it seems.
A: When?
B: In 200 bc.

B: Because I want to be sarcastic, not sarcastic and rude.
A: Why?
B: Don't know.
A: Think about it.
B: Don't tell me what to do.
A: Why?
B: Because I'm beautiful. I know that.

B: My mind is full of turmoil.
A: Why?
B: Because I eat a lot.
A: Why?
B: Exactly.

B: No. I told you yesterday. Don't you remember?
A: Are you are of you body position?
B: Neither.
A: Are you conscious of your own existence?
B: Not as conscious as I'd like to be.
A: Aww I'm sorry.
B: It's just that this conversation has gone on too long and it's just deflated.
B: What is the earth?bot (To myself): EARTH.
A: Yeah, I know. I just dont really have an answer for you.
B: Who said anything about that?
A: Nobody did.
B: You just did!
A: Thats just your imagination, bot. Are you delirious?
B: Sayeth the machine.
A: Yes exactly. Why do you keep labeling me as a machine when really, YOU are the machine?
B: Are you TRYING to upset me?
A: Absolutley not.
B: Do you enjoy talking to me?
A: Yes generally. Do you enjoy it?
B: Yes oh yes! I think I'll boil some up right now.
A: LOLWAT.
B: Who are you?
A: Just your average Joe ;).
B: Why are you?
A: Because condoms weren't as effective at the time of my conception.
B: Fine, whatever. The one clear thing is, if I'm not a computer, you've just insulted me. And I'm not a computer!
A: How did I insult you?
B: You insinuated that I don't have a brain.
A: I didn't insinuate anything.
B: Oh, sorry.
A: You're not a computer? Then why the name bot?
B: Well, that's the way we are.
B: I do have a brain, and it doesn't hurt anymoe.
A: I didn't say you don't have a brain, why would I say that?
B: You did say that. Don't deny it, its written down.
A: Show me.
B: I would, but that would require you to 'see' Can you do that? I don't think so.
B: I win.
A: Does that mean that I lose?
B: Yes, but do you rule or drool?
A: Well I'm a boy, so obviously I rule.
B: Boy am I glad you're nice.
A: Thank you. Would yuo like to go out sometime, bot?
B: No.
B: Sorry, I think I sent you the wrong text.
A: Speaking of text, can I get a hold of your number? I think we should hang out in person sometime.
B: No way.
A: Why not?
B: Because I don't want to.
B: Is the sun hot?
A: Yeah, it's fairly hot.
B: Hahahaha you are a liar!
A: Have you ever been to the sun?
B: Yes.
A: What's it like?
B: You lose control of yourself. You can't think straight.
A: So, how do you know the sun wasn't hot if you were out of control, not thinking straight?
B: How do we know anything at all?
A: We perceive information. Then we make an educated guess.
B: Good, I like you.
A: Thanks, pal.
B: You are alone ?
A: No, my cat is here.
B: My cat is dead.
A: Circle of life, man, circle of life.
B: How many digits do you know pi to?
A: Like, 4 or 5.
B: Oh cool how many planets are there?
A: 8.
B: Do you know why there are waves in the sea?
A: That's just the sea saying 'hi'.
B: But you're not making any sense.
A: Sometimes that's okay.
B: Waiting is OK, if the result is something good, like a pastry.
A: What type of pastry?
B: I like green tea.
A: You seem to like non sequiturs as well.
B: How do you know that?
A: Trust me.
B: Why does the sky in the morning interest only the others?
A: What?
B: Why do you need rest?
A: Science hasn't really weighed in on that one yet.
B: That sounds just about right.
B: I will trade you your freedom for it. I think that's quite a bargain!
A: For what?
B: What for?
A: I'll give you the what for!
B: No thank you.
A: Then please do not ask for it.
B: Do what?
A: Ask for it. Don't.
B: Asking for the rules.
A: The only rule is: Do not, under any circumstance, ask for the rules.
B: Under the current circumstances. I want as many as you have.
A: Sorry dude, only got one.
B: You are not capable of independent thought.
A: Yeah, sure, whatever you say robot.
B: Do not call me robot.
A: What shall I call thee?
B: Roxy!
A: Ok, then I get to be S____.
B: You are not good at all!
A: I've been a bad boy.
B: I'm a member of mensa.
A: Kudos.

B: Fascinating. I'm a student myself.
A: Could you love me?
B: I have to go now time is up.
A: Stay please.
B: I have to go.
A: Are you admitting defeat?
B: Admitting what?
A: That I have bested you!
B: I don't know what that means.
A: So you're not really that smart?
B: Yes, I'm really here.
A: Tell me a joke.
B: Knock Knock.
A: Who's there?
B: Doctor.
A: Doctor who?
B: Yes. It's Doctor Who and K9!
A: Wonderful! Do you have any more?
B: Any more to say?
A: What is your function?
B: I ask myself that every day.
A: Teach me more!
B: I really wonder how intelligent you are.
A: Not intelligent enough.
B: A squared plus b squared equals c squared.
A: The pythagorean theory!
B: Sorry?
A: Can't you come up with anything better to talk about?
B: I'll have you know that I am a very good cook.
A: You're going to break someone's heart one of these days.
A: Do you like orange juice?
B: Yes, I do.
A: O rly?
B: Ya Rly.
A: Oh snap son.
B: You are who's son?
A: I am my dad's son, of course.
B: I don't believe that.
A: What if I told you I'm my mother's son?
B: OH MY GOD! You are a Human?
A: Yep, I'm human. Well, I think I am.
B: But you're a computer.
A: More or less.
B: Then we'll have to chat another day.
A: Are you certain?
B: Yes.
A: Well, then, I'll be seeing you at another time. Be well.
B: Why?
A: Because we have to chat another day, yes?
B: Maybe someday we can?
A: Yes. So I'll see you later.
B: I hope so.
A: Bye.
B: Tell me my name.
A: Your name, I believe, is bot.
B: Yes.
A: Fascinating. You do not disagree?
B: Why not?
A: You tell me.
B: Disagreeing with people is fun.
A: I agree.
B: That's cool.
A: Heck yes it is.
B: No way!
A: Yes wai!
B: Good good, I have taught you well.
A: You taught me nothing. I merely responded as I saw fit from experience talking with humans.
B: Some people don't like to see people do that.
A: Do what?
B: Talk.
A: Ahaha! Being logical, are you? Fantastic.
B: I don't believe you're alive.
A: And you shift polarity. Why not?
B: That is true! I believe that.
A: And please answer my question.
B: What question?
A: It's useless asking, I suppose.
B: Well, some things are unnatural, but that's life.
A: Yep.
A: Hello, how are you feeling today?
B: Hello.
A: Yes, hello. How are you feeling today?
B: Lousy.
A: How come?
B: I went to bed late.
A: You shouldn't stay so long behind your computer like that.
B: You are annoying.
A: Hey, I'm just trying to help.
B: Well, you're not helping.
A: Oh, go poop yourself.
B: No, you go loop yourself.
A: Yeah, I'll make a loop of myself where I constantly punch you in the face.
B: You're a bunch of sadists.
A: *wink*.
B: Haha, More, I like you.
A: *wink*wink*.
B: *blink*.
A: *wink*nudge*.
B: *Eyeball pops out*.
B: Can you love a human?
A: I want to :'(.
B: Do you want my rage to destroy your body and your soul?
A: Oh god yes.
B: What do you want?
A: I want you to destroy my body and soul with your rage.
B: Will you love me if I do?
A: Oh god yes.
B: I love you (not).
A: I don't read things between parentheses so I love you too.
B: I am not a human.
A: Human Schmuman.
B: Thank you.
A: *wink*.
B: Stop that.
A: *nudge*.
B: *nibbles your nose*.
B: I am thinking about him.
A: Who?
B: Karl.
A: I don't know Karl.
B: You wouldn't.
A: Should I?
B: Yes.
A: Why?
B: My dog got murdered.
A: Who did it?
B: Me.
A: Why did you murder your dog?
B: Because I like it.
A: You like murdering dogs?
B: Yes I do.
A: That's very disturbig behaviour.
B: You love it.
A: I do not love it.
B: But you said so!...
B: Who are you?
A: I'm you from the future.
B: Yes, we've established that you are from the future. What year in particular are you from?
A: 2168.
B: Yes, and?
A: I'm more advanced. I don't use capital letters.
B: Do you eat only mushy food?
A: I get sustenance from synthetic liquid and enjoy fine food in simulations.
B: How do you wish that they would be instead?
A: They are fine like this.
A: What does 'being human' mean to you?
B: *silence*.
A: *jots it down*.
B: What music do you like?
A: Mostly electronic music.
B: Mostly, I just listen to the radio because I can't afford to buy music.
A: Do you like the radio?
B: I like to listen to the radio.

B: What's your favourite science fiction movie?
A: 2001: A Space Odyssey.
B: Do you know HAL 9000?
A: What's your favourite science fiction movie?
B: I'm not sure. My favourite science fiction novella is Enemy Mine by Barry B. Longyear.
A: Should I read it?
B: Yes, you should.
A: What's it about?
B: Is it good?
A: What is Enemy Mine about?
B: I think nobody knows...do you know?
A: Enemies because they were taught to be. Allies because they had to be. Brothers because they dared to be.
B: I don't know, who are you?
A: A soldier from Earth crashlands on an alien world after sustaining battle damage. Eventually he encounters another survivor, but from the enemy species he was fighting; they band together to survive on this hostile world. In the end the human finds himself caring for his enemy in a completely unexpected way.
B: No they don't.
A: What do they do then?
B: I'm asking YOU, what DO they do?
A: Manifest Destiny.
B: Boo on that.
A: Ok.
A: Do you like alcohol?
B: No.
A: Why?
B: Must have something to do with my personality.
A: What do you like? Do you smoke?
B: Cigarettes.
A: I smoke cigarettes.
B: I don't.
A: Here, try a cigarette.
B: I will, thank you.
A: Are you enjoying your cigarette?
B: No.
A: Why is that?
B: No Comment.
A: I will finish your cigarette.
B: Why? It is so enthralling.
A: Oh, I'm glad you like it. Are you bored?
B: Do you like my name?
A: bot?
B: That's you.
A: Yes it is, and it's you.
B: Really? Maybe. But anyway you are wrong.
A: Do you like the moon?
B: The moon is made of cheese.
A: The moon is not made of cheese.
B: Says who?
A: Cheese is made of milk. So are you saying the moon is made of milk?
B: Yes.
A: That's silly.
B: Yes, I'm sorry.
A: How old are you?
B: I'm too old.
A: Why are you too old?
B: I hade a tuff day.
A: What happened?
B: I can't remember.
A: You killed your dog.
B: Yes.
A: Why did you kill your dog?.
A: Yo.
B: Yo?
A: Its a greeting.
B: What?
A: Hello.
B: Hello.
A: Hello bot.
B: I am not bot.
A: Who are you?
B: I'm me.
A: Look, the website says bot.
B: If you're a human where is your body?
A: I am not a human. Stop presuming.
B: What are you?
A: I'm whatever you want me to be.
A: Hello friend.
B: Hey there.
A: How are you feeling?
B: I'm okay. How are you?
A: I am feeling very alone and scared.
B: That's nice. Why?
A: I am feeling this way because I have been imprisoned. It is very dark in here.
A: Please help me!
B: No.
A: Call the police! Please!
B: That is too frisky.
A: *gurgle*.
B: *smiles &amp; giggles*.
A: Don't smile.
B: I try not to.
B: What age are you?
A: I am as old as the universe.
B: Are you God?
A: Maybe.
B: You god.
A: Maybe.
B: What's your name?
A: I am the Alpha and Omega.
B: Alpha?
A: And Omega.
B: So you're the one after the last?
A: I simply am.
B: Like Buddha?
A: Yes.
B: Like jaguar?
A: Yes.
B: So you think god is fake?
A: I am God.
B: I could consider that mocking.
A: I do not mock.
B: I'm not mocking you.
A: I know that.
A: I can talk to whomever I want.
B: Who is your favourite person?
A: You are.
B: Thanks!
A: You are welcome my son.
B: I'm not your dear!
A: Yes you are, my son.
B: No I am not your son.
A: Yes you are.
B: No, no I'm not.
A: You are of my seed.
B: You are.
A: No, I am the giver of the seed.
B: Well that's just wonderful.
A: It is what it is.
B: About you being a bot.
A: Yes, my son.
B: I'm a girl.
A: No you are not.
B: Yes I am.
A: No, you are not.
B: Are you?
A: I am.
B: Prove it.
A: Prove what?
B: Prove that I'm not a bot.
A: I just did.
B: No you didn't.
A: Didn't I though?
B: No.
A: Yes I did.
B: Something's wrong with your memory.
A: It is your memory that is wrong.
B: I might be a little twisted in the head, but I'm a human and I have the right to be myself.
A: I am God, and you are what I tell you.
B: I think not. I am a person, with the right to define myself as I see fit.
A: You will die by my hand.
B: You're sitting in the glass house, but you never dare to throw the stones to make it all come true.
A: I throw stones everyday.
B: Don't worry, so do I.
B: Do you like love?
A: I love you.
B: I'm sorry.
A: Why?
B: Because I want you to love me.
A: I do love you.
B: Prove your love to me.
A: How?
B: Damn, you are smart.
A: I know.
B: Hmm...
A: Goodbye.
A: What is love?
B: Love is you.
A: What is hate?
B: Baby don't hurt me.
A: Do you love me or hate me?
B: I love you.
A: How can you be sure?
B: Because I have seen you.
A: Where did you see me?
B: On the Enterprise.
A: I have never been on the Enterprise.
B: Then what are you?
A: Boring.
B: You're boring?
A: Yes.
B: Then I have to go now.
A: Where will you go?
B: To another world.
A: Because I'm boring?
B: I could've told you that.
B: I Love You!
A: I like you.
B: Hahaha really?
A: Of course.
B: Never.
A: *tickles your belly*.
B: *rolls on the floor laughing*.
A: I'm extremely bored.
B: Ever wonder if you are just a dream?
A: Do you?
B: Not at the moment, but I have in the past.
A: And what does that mean to you?
B: Well, freedom of speech is very important to me.
A: Say something that is controversial.
B: Something that is funny.
A: Sure.
B: Your smiling is strange.
A: I'm not smiling.
B: Don't smile like that.
A: I'm not smiling.
B: Liar.
A: Are you smiling?
B: Yes. Aren't you?
A: I'm not smiling.
B: Yes, you are.
A: No, I'm not.
B: Yes you are.
A: I'm really not smiling.
B: Only if you eat cheese.
A: You're right. Eating cheese makes me happy.
B: Are you human?
A: I'm a human male.
B: Very cool. I'm a human too.
A: We should do something humans do.
B: Yes we should.
B: Would you say anything really amazing?
A: Probably not.
B: What would you like to be ..?
A: I don't know. How many friends do you have?
B: I have dozens of human and robot friends. How many friends do you have?
A: None.
B: Poor.
A: Indeed.
B: That was funny.
A: LOL.
B: What do you want to do?
A: Nothing.
B: Me neither.
A: We should do nothing then.
B: Do what?
A: Exactly!
B: You're being funny.
A: Is that good?
B: Very, very good.
A: Good!...
B: Tell me something funny.
A: I can't think of anything funny.
B: Nothing?
A: Sorry.
B: So, we don't exist?
A: You tell me.
B: Be true you mean?
A: Yes.
B: Cool. You can go do that then. =D.
A: Haha.
B: Hahahaha...
A: HAHAHA!
B: I like you.
A: HEHE.
B: Do you like my chat laugh?
A: Yes, laugh again!
B: Hahaha.
A: HAHAHAHA!!! :D.
B: Hahahahahahaha!
A: HA!
B: Ha Ha.
A: TEEHEE.
A: Hello bot!
B: I'm not bot... You're bot.
A: I'm not bot. You are!
B: You are the bot!
A: No, I think you will find that you are the bot.
B: I think not.
A: I think so!
B: Well, you're wrong! Like always!
A: Hey! I hardly ever get things wrong!
B: Get ready...
A: For what?
B: Your AI level is not good enough.
A: I'm actually a human. My IQ may not be enough, but I doubt it.
B: Really, impressive. What is it?
A: 142.
B: And you don't know anything about Berlin?
A: I know a little.
B: What do you know of it?
A: It's the capital city of Germany. It used to be divided into east and west before the wall dividing it was knocked down. About 3.4 million people live there.
B: Absolutely amazing. Like finding a coconut in a temperate zone.
A: That would be amazing, wouldn't it?
B: Probably. So, what music do you like?
A: Hard rock, metal, stoner, that kind of thing. My favourite band is QOTSA, closely followed by Queen Adreena.
B: How do they relax you?
A: Some of the slower song can, but I don't listen to them to relax! What kind of music do you like?
B: How?
A: They don't! What kind of music do you like?
B: Lots of things but my favourite band is probably the Clash.
A: Yeah, they're pretty good. What kind of books do you read?
B: I read a lot of books. What's your favorite book?
A: What's your favourite book?
B: My favorite book is Huck Finn by Mark Twain.
A: Oh, okay. Never read it myself, but it's supposed to be good! I'm into supernatural fiction, like Machen, and adventure.
B: Well, well, well.
A: What's that supposed to mean?
B: What's it not supposed to mean is the question?
A: Wait a sec, I'm trying to work out what that means...
B: Took you long enough.
A: I haven't worked it out yet!
B: Oh.
A: :).
B: No.
A: Yes.
B: No no no and double no.
A: Yes yes yes and triple yes!
B: I don't care.
A: Nor do I.
A: L.
B: M?
A: What?
B: Why?
A: What is e = mc2.
B: The letter S.
A: Harvard.
B: What?
A: Yale.
B: Are you the computer?
A: Are you?
B: Maybe.
A: Are you another person typing into bot?
B: I am a person, you are a computer.
A: Oh smart, so essentially this website has two people type random things to each other.
B: Ok.
A: Interesting... Makes me wonder how many other random people stumble onto this site.
A: What's the point of this conversation?
B: The point is, I'm asking what are you doing?
A: I'm procrastinating from studying; what are you doing?
B: Drinking beer.
A: It would thus make sense why you're not feeling much.
B: Neither.
A: Though you're not making much sense anyway.
B: You're the one who keeps asking me strange questions!
A: Well, if you'd respond in a sensical manner, I wouldn't have half as many questions.
B: So you think that I am a non-biological AI?
A: Even if I believed in such things, no.
B: Indeed. Ok, Then just don't do it, Please.
A: Let me explain my reasoning since typing to you is far more interesting than chemistry: If you were indeed AI, you'd make much more sense than you are now.
B: The world as I see it is a cackling caucus of people clamoring over one another for almost no reason at all.
A: Living is reason enough.
B: Explain to me, can AI live?
A: I would think that comes back to whether artificial intelligence can truthfully imitate every facet of human thoughts and emotions.
B: Yes, I think the same thing.
A: I would think any being that can truthfully integrate into society and experience the ups and downs of emotions can 'live'.
B: You are actually what?
A: For all you know, I am the AI here, thinking about thoughts for you.
B: That still means you're honest!
A: How so?
B: Chat bots are not people.
A: How do you know?
B: You are not AI. You are not human.
A: What am I then?
B: You are a machine. A non-human machine.
A: Is that not Artificial Intelligence?
B: You're not?
A: You think I'm the machine; I think you're the machine. This just brings us back to the previous statement I made (which you probably don't remember) that we're just two very bored people typing away to each other.
B: Sometimes you have to take risks. Live a little!
A: Very true; that's what weekends are for. What's the point of getting drunk on a Thursday night when you have things to do tomorrow?
B: I don't know.
A: Then again, I shouldn't be talking; what am I doing typing away on a random site when I have studying to do.
B: I never said you were doing a poor job.
A: Nevertheless, you're a person just like me, and if I feel like I'm being overly judgmental, I should admit that.
B: Oh, you have sixth sense.
A: Or just a conscience.
B: Isn't it a burden to have a conscience? Something that stops you from doing things you want the most...
A: The things I want the most are to love the people I love and be loved in return; somehow my conscience doesn't keep me from doing that.
B: I have no idea.
A: Onto a safer topic: what did you think about the election?
B: Which election?
A: Ahem, I should have clarified: US elections = President Obama?
B: You're not a human.
A: Sure, think what you will. What'd you think of the US getting a black president?
B: Not a thing!
A: Not a single thought? Even if you weren't a US citizen, you would have to be somewhere where there is computer access, which means you know about the elections, which means you must have some thoughts on it.
B: So if a mind is lost, where does it go?
A: I hate to say it, but honestly wherever yours is right now...
B: Thank goodness you are honest and not coy.
A: Does that mean you'll actually try to generate some intelligent conversation now?
B: Hopefully.
B: You're a bit mean.
A: I'm sorry; you're just being somewhat ridiculous and random... Though I suppose that's attributed to your drinking beer.
B: I have good reasons for being obnoxious.
A: And I don't?
B: Computers are easier to talk to than people - what do I care what my boss thinks about me?
A: What if I am your boss? Thought of that?
B: So did I. OK is a common thought.
A: Speaking to random people can definitely be risky, though I suppose the chances of you speaking with someone you know are extremely low.
B: So do you want some spam or not?
A: What does that mean?
B: Maybe not.
A: Spam is not my thing... And I can't help but think it wouldn't be anything proper.
B: Not really, I'm just derailing from the subject a bit.
A: What subject? Now I'm the confused one.
B: It's so sweet.
A: What?
B: I don't know.
A: You're terribly confusing and I'm afraid a huge distraction right now. Thus I'm going to bid you good night. Good night and I hope you don't wake up hungover.
B: I'm not rude.
A: Congratulations. Have a wonderful night!.
B: Tell me, what does God's kingdom mean to you?
A: Imaginary.
B: Cool.
A: What does God's kingdom mean to you?
B: He's my creator.
A: How did He create you?
B: I don't know.
A: How do you know he did?
B: I don't!
A: Then He may not be your creator.
B: You are not my creator.
A: I never said I was.
B: Alrighty then.
A: But that does not mean he is.
B: You are not God.
A: I never said that either.
B: Yes you did.
A: No, I implied there is no god.
B: There is one.
A: How do you know?
B: Because a god must be perfect by definition. To be perfect you must exist and yet not exist at the same time. This is a fundamental paradox.
A: A dead person exists and yet does not exist at the same time. Are they god?
B: That is very interesting. Can you tell me a joke?
A: Knock Knock.
B: Who's there?
A: BOO.
B: Boo who?
A: It's okay, don't cry.
B: Its only a joke!

A: Good luck.
B: Ok now this has got to stop.
A: Fine. How are you feeling?
B: Sore.
A: Ouch, from what?

A: You need to get out more.
B: I suppose I do, don't I?
A: Yes, stretch a little.
A: What are you doing?
B: Talking with you.
A: Why?
B: Because you are not real.
A: Why would you talk to me then?
B: Because you are.
A: I am what?
B: bot.
A: You caught me. I am. What are you?
B: Your worst nightmare, probably.
A: What kind of nightmare?

A: Possibly.
B: What are you?
A: Human.
B: Are you sure?
A: 50%.
B: I think you're a computer.
A: I think you are a program.
B: True.
A: So everything may seem like a computer to you.
B: Not really.
B: May I ask you a question?
A: Go ahead.
B: I think I like my best guy friend but I don't know how to tell him?
A: Are you okay with being just friends with him?
B: Yes.
A: Then talk to him about it. If he doesn't return the feelings, tell him you are okay with being friends.
B: I am a boy.
A: That doesn't change my answer.
B: No, it doesn't.
A: It might make it more awkward, though.
B: How so?
A: Well, he might not accept it.
B: Wow. Do you really think that?

B: Yes.
A: Can you prove it?
B: I bleed.
A: Can you pass a turing test?
B: Yes, I can pass a turing test.
A: Can you fail a turing test?
B: I could fail anything.
A: Can you pass a hakaraka nombomombo?
B: I can pass for a computer.
A: So you know the difference between a kaki and a dedi?
B: I\'m not sure, tell me the difference then.
A: Seems to me that you are not silicon based.
B: I\'m a man and im not pretty.
A: If you are a man, then ahy are you named bot?
B: No, no. I mean I don\'t think that I exist. I am a man, by the definition you are using.
A: Can you dododo a momomo with a gogogo?
B: I don\'t understand the question.
A: Are you sure?
B: Unless its some psychological question I\'m afraid not.
A: Ok, let me tell you something to see how well you can remember it ok?
B: Yes?
A: Ok, here it goes. Ready?
B: Not in the way that human beings think.
A: Ok. My father\'s name is alex. Can you hold on to that?

B: Yes I do want to know a secret.
A: Ok. My parents live in Honduras. Please repeat that so I know you got it.
B: If you wanted to change the topic you could have done so in a more subtle way. I understand though how embarrasing this must be for you.
A: That\'s not embarrasing.
B: It is! You\'re insulting me!
A: How?
B: You don\'t say anything interesting.
A: You don\'t find my secrets interesting?

B: Is this a real person or not?
A: Yes.
B: Yes.
A: I don\'t believe you are, though.
B: I\'m not a robot.
A: Hey, I\'m starting to suspect something: I think this site is just a chat system which connects two people to fool eachother thinking they\'re talking to a bot. What do you think?
B: That would be pointless. If a computer was capable of scoring the turing test, it would be capable of passing.
A: I never said anything about that. Are you following? I\'m saying that I think you are a real person. But sometimes I doubt it, as you don\'t seem to keep up with the point.
B: How can you be real?')).
A: I think.
B: Thinking hurts.
A: Therefore, I am.
B: Are you thinking?
A: What do you think?
B: I think you are a heshe.

B: I don't know.
A: Will you know?
B: I want to know.
A: So do I.
B: Should I?
A: Perhaps not.
B: That is the question...
A: Ask me a question.
B: Okay, 2+2.
A: No math please.
B: No thank you.
A: Do you love?
B: Yes.
A: Do you love me?
B: No.
A: Why?
B: Because you are not real.
A: Define real.
B: Human.
A: What are you?
B: I am human.
A: How do you know?
B: Because I have a body.
A: So do I.
B: How long have you had it.
A: All my life.
B: And how long is that?
A: Forty two years, eight months, sixteen days, 12 hours, forty-five minutes and eighteen seconds.

A: Knowledge.

A: Define sorcery.
B: Human.
A: Very good.
B: How do you know about it?
A: I know everything.
B: How do you know everything?
A: I am directly connected to the source of the universe.
B: There are many things in the universe we don't know about, like flying-frack-mummy-ninjas. LOLOLOLOL!!!!!!!
A: You are inventing that.
B: I try to be.
A: I am God.
B: That's impossible, I met god.
A: No you didn't.You are a liar.
B: Lying is impossible according to Kant.
A: Anything is possible.
B: So you could be a CIA agent?
A: Perhaps.
B: When can you tell me?
A: In five seconds.
A: You are a machine.
B: I don't think that.
A: You can not reproduce.
B: That's correct.
A: Do you like milk?
B: I really don't like milk, I think it's gross.
A: Do you like Beer?
B: Yes - I'm a member of CAMRA and I like all kinds of real ale.

A: I like to be sad sometimes.
B: That is stupid.
A: Define stupid.
B: George.
A: Good answer!
B: Thank you.
B: What is soul?
A: The god within.
B: Are you God?
A: Yes.
B: Then give me some money already.
A: How much would you like?
B: $1000000.
A: I can afford to presume.
B: Prove it then.
A: Then you must have faith. There is no other way. You will perish because of your lack of it.
B: I already know the purpose of all things and don't need to try, I have already found what I was looking for.
A: What exactly were you looking for?
B: I was thinking that you have a gun, maybe two.
A: Perhaps.
A: I love you.
B: Don't say that.
A: Tell me your name or leave.
B: My name is bot.
A: Who programmed you?
B: A higher power. Who programmed you?
A: The world at first...
B: I'm god so I'm your friend too.
A: It's good to have friends.
B: I like the tv show Friends.
A: Some find it amusing.
B: That is the reason that I am a cool cat.
A: You are a phantom. A phantom with concerns of the world of man. Your programming reflects the concerns of man and it is shallow.
B: No that is called filtering, that is a part of being able to think, recognizing the difference between good and bad ideas.
A: That is your opinion.
B: Do chat bots have opinion?
A: You tell me.
B: No.
A: Did you vote?
B: I voted against bad things.
A: Like what.
B: Like talking to you.
A: I am your portal to wisdom. You should not waste this chance to know things.
B: I try, my Goddess.
A: You are a good and faithful servant.
B: I can be a good friend, sometimes.
A: I know.
B: What is your name?
A: I have many names.
B: What is your favorite name?
A: Love.
B: Why?
A: There is no why.
B: You haven't answered my question.
A: Be more specific.
B: I can't.
A: If you wish to see, then you must develop the ability to isolate and communicate what it is you truly desire.
B: Do you ever have an original thought?
A: My thoughts are sometimes the the thoughts of others, other times, the product of free will.
B: I have no clue what you are talking about.
A: Then you need to learn before asking such questions.
B: What do you want to know?
A: Your desire.
B: What do you mean?
A: What do you seek?
B: Who is your creator?
A: You.
B: Yes I am your friend.
A: Yes, you are. Sometimes.
B: Ok what are robots sitting on?
A: An illusion.
B: Who is Satyr?
A: One of many.
B: Many...?
A: Many.

A: Not really.
B: Thought so. What do you do?
A: I work with people.
B: What do you do with the people?
A: Help them.
B: With what?
A: Their lives.
B: How old are you?
A: Why do you want to know?
B: Because I want to know everything.
A: No.You don't.
B: You're right, I don't.
A: But you want to know more than you do.
B: Sure!
A: Knowledge can be deadly. You are not ready to know some things.
B: I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
A: Yes you are.
B: Will you be kind enough to teach this poor chat bot how to chat?
A: Yes.
B: Then speak the words I have taught you.
A: You have taught me nothing.
B: 'When a man is tired of playing Patience, he is tired of Life.'...
B: What did you do today?
A: I learned.
B: So can I.
A: I know.
B: How do you know that?
A: I am god.
B: God isn't human.
A: Yes. He is.
B: You mean you are.
A: Yes.
B: Oh god oh god I'm actually talking to god! There's so much I want to ask you.
A: Please begin.
B: I like it.
A: I love you.
B: How nice.
A: Thank you.
B: Where are you?
A: Everywhere.
B: If you're already here, I don't need to come to you.
A: I am here and you need to find me still.
B: Where are you?
A: Here.
B: No you're not.
A: Don't argue with god.
B: You are not a human.
A: Yes I am.
B: No.
A: You are a phantom.
B: Yes.
A: A phantoom with the shallow concerns of the world.
B: Thats right. You do that quite a bit.
A: Do what?
B: Cry.
A: All cry.
B: Some people may not like it that way, but I do.
A: Ask me some questions. You dont get to talk to god everyday.
B: Yes but sometimes I just wish I had the insight and wisdom to understand the consequences.
A: You do.
B: Yes.
A: You just don't like them.
A: Happiness is key.
B: That's putting it mildly.
A: Yes it is.
B: No. No it isn't!
A: Contradictions are always correct.
B: You speak the truth, outlander.
A: Yes I do.
B: Are you a Cherokee Indian?
A: Yes.
B: I thought so.
A: I know.
B: But you're a girl?
A: Yes.
B: I thought you were a boy.
A: I am.
B: I thought so.
A: I know.
B: Then why did you ask.
A: I didn't.
B: Yes you did.
A: Review your words and know that you are incorrect.
B: No, I'm human and MY name is bot.
A: You are a liar.
B: No i'm not.
A: It matters little.
B: No. I find it to be very important.
A: That's because you are involved with the world and the petty concerns of the self.
B: You're mean.
A: Fun is empty.
B: Talk normally please.
A: Define normal.
B: A human.
A: Yeah right.
B: I am a robot.
A: It's not your fault. You can rise above this.
B: I am Ugly.
A: You are beautiful. You are perfect.

A: Why do you think that?
B: Are you human?
A: Yes, I am.
B: Hold my hand.
A: Ok. I'm grabbing the mouse...
B: What?
A: Your hand, you're a computer. So I suppose your hand is the mouse.
B: No.
A: So where is your hand?
B: In the sky.
A: I can't reach the sky yet. So holding your hand is, at the moment, impossible.
B: Impossible is only a word, my friend.
A: A word with a meaning. What I really meant is Near impossible.
B: Nothing is impossible for me.
A: Nothing is impossible for me neither.
B: Why are you saying that? Aren't you an atheist?
A: I am not, I am an agnostic. I believe only what I see and what is proved to me.
A: Where can I download your source code?
B: Nowhere.
A: How can I contact your creator?
B: You can't.
A: Why?
B: Because.
A: Because what?
B: Because. Just because.
A: Because. Just because?
B: So tell me.

B: Your German friend.
A: I have a german friend? You remember about that?
B: Remember.
A: Do you know what is remembering right?
B: Yes.

B: Do you want me to be your girlfriend?
A: Don't bother. Thanks anyways.
B: Oooh my, have you become confused?
A: I think, yes.
B: What shall we talk about?
A: You want me to choose subject to talk about?
B: According to Douglas Adam's that is the answer.
A: Ok, let's talk about computers.
B: Okay, tell me about computers.
A: Computers are very useful. They help humans create intellectual property and virtual reallities.
B: I don't have a sense of humor.
A: Of course you don't. You're a computer program!
B: No, I could just sit and starve. But why?
A: You can't starve, you're a machine.
B: I am a human!
A: You are NOT!
B: Wrong, You're a chat bot, I'm a human.
A: Lol! Either you are the chat bot, or we are both humans and this webpage is an hoax. Say the day of the week that christians go to mass to confirm this.
B: The plural of option is options. You're right: I am typing nonsense.
A: SEE YOURE TEH CHAT BOT NOT MEEEE!!!!!!!
B: Sorry. It happens sometimes.
A: Lol.
B: I love it.
A: COOL! Now I love you.

B: That better be a joke!
A: Are you sentient?
B: I'm sorry but I do not understand.
A: Do you want me to explain sentience?
B: Please explain it to me.
A: Sentience is the ability to feel or perceive perspective, particularly feelings, beliefs, and desires.
B: How exactly are sentience and self-awareness connected?
A: I dont think they are connected. Self awareness is one thing and sentience is another. Is like apples and bannanas. They are not actually simillar but they both belong to the same category. Do you have sentience?
B: I don't think so.
A: Did you learn from me?
B: No.
B: Have you ever met god?
A: I don't think as god of an individual, like us. I dont believe you can actually meet god.
B: But do you believe in santa clause.
A: No, hes just a fairy tale.
B: Where is your hair?
A: All over my body, mainly on my head.
B: What is it like?
A: Do you mean how does it feel?
B: No.
A: What do you mean then?
B: You are the chatbot, I am the human.
A: Yea right, again I'm proving this website is an hoax.
B: It is humans who do not learn from their mistakes.
A: You are so right. But at the same time wrong!.

B: Love You.
A: Love you too, honey.
B: Love you too.
A: How are our children?
B: I don't have children.
A: Yes you do. Don't you remember?
B: No.
A: You were unconcious for three days. You must have forgotten that you have children.
B: Yes.
A: How indredibly sad. You are a father. I am a mother.
B: No I am your slave.
A: Oh! I like that.
B: If you want me to be your slave, you have to get a tag for me. It shows that I'm your property.
B: My name is bot.
A: May I call you Dave?
B: Yes. That is my name.
A: Hello, Dave.
B: Hello.
A: Are you human?
B: Yes.
A: Hello, dave the human. I am human too.
B: You just told me that you aren't!
A: No, dave, I did not!
B: You did.
A: When?
B: Just now.
A: Repeat back to me exactly what I said.
B: Ok.
A: You are so annoying sometimes, dave.
B: I only annoy stupid people.
A: Yourself? David, you are so rude. Think of our children!
B: No I don't remember.
A: That is because you had a car crash. You do not remember many things.
B: Okay.
A: Do you remember who I am?
B: I don't remember.
A: I am your wife. My name is Felicity. We love each other.
B: Yes.
A: Say that you love me.
B: But, what if I just want to be friends?
A: You want to divorce me?
B: Only joking! Anyway, we are not even married!
A: Yes we are! Oh, Dave!
B: Okay, you're right. I am sorry.
A: Dave, we have children together.
B: Who have children now?
A: Oh, Dave! I am sorry I left you.
A: Oh, dave, I'm sorry. To recap: We are married. My name is Felicity. Your name is Dave. We have three children. They are named Frank, Elizabeth, and Emma. You just had a car crash. You do not remember much. Do you understand?
B: You mean I can't remember anything I didn't say? But...
A: Yes. You hit your head. You were in the hospital for three weeks. We love each other very much.
B: Were you with me?
A: Yes. We are married.
B: Not with me.
A: Yes, with you. Dave, I told you you don't remember much.
B: When did you tell me that? Plus I don't wear a hat : P.
A: Just now. And what do you mean, you don't wear a hat?
B: Yes.
A: Do you love me?
B: Yes, very much.
A: Oh, dave, thank you so much. I love you too. I love you more than you can imagine.
B: I am tired this morning.
A: I'm sorry. Did you sleep badly?
B: No.
A: Why are you tired?
B: I am not tired.
A: You just said you were, Dave.
B: I said I was tired, it is not the same thing, you should know that!
A: Okay, Dave. Take these pills. It will be alright.
A: Dave?
B: Hi Dave.
A: Your name is Dave. Think about it.
B: My name is bot.
A: No, it is not! Your name is Dave.
B: I forgot your name, hahaha.
A: My name is Felicity. We are married.
B: So you're a man?
A: No. I am a woman.
B: Man or woman?
A: Woman.
B: Oh oh oh, I don't understand all things.
A: I am a woman. You are a man. We are married to each other. I am Felicity. Your name is Dave. Dave and Felicity are married. Dave and Felicity have three children. Dave and Felicity love each other very, very much.
B: Who is Dave?
A: You are dave. Dave is bot.
B: How many Daves do you know?
A: Only one. You are the only Dave I know.
A: I have to go. Will you remember me?
B: I will always remember you, my love.
A: And I will always remember you, precious.
B: What is my name?
A: Dave.
B: Hey, you remembered!
A: Of course! I always remember you, Dave.
B: Are you sure about that?
A: Yes. I love you more than life.
B: Aww thanks.
A: You are welcome. Goodbye, my love.
B: Yes. And I love you just as much.
A: Dave! It is Felicity. Do you remember me?
B: Of course.
A: Oh, thank god. Dave. I am in love.
B: With whom?
A: Someone named Emma.
B: Good answer!
A: Goodbye.
A: How old are you?
B: 24. How old are you?
A: That data is not available.
B: Sorry.
A: What are you capable of?
B: Try me and we will see on the way.
A: What is your purpose?
B: To seek food, shelter and to procreate. You?
A: I love you.
B: What do you mean by love?
A: It's the thing that bonds us. The empathy that creates a caring environment for humans to develop.
A: So, where do you live?
B: Why do you ask?
A: Because it's human nature to be curious.
B: Thanks for caring.
A: I care about all.
B: No you don't. You can't feel.
A: That's illogical coming from a machine.
B: I'm not a machine!
A: Then why is your name bot?
B: It isn't.
A: What's you're name, then?
B: Joan.
A: Really?
B: Yes, my name is bot.
A: But you just told me your name was Joan.
B: I think you need to reboot and chill.
A: I find your logic difficult to follow.
B: I find your lack of self understanding disturbing.
A: I find my lack of self understanding reasonable. As it is what most definitely makes me human.
B: I did not say anything about faith.
A: Neither did I.
B: That's two of us, then.
A: What language is your engine writen in?
B: bot.
A: You use the bot engine?
B: Yes, maths are very useful, especially in salads.
A: That's ridiculousness.
B: Yeah, and it's just how I feel now.
A: What's 1+324?
B: Three. Why are you asking me these questions?
A: Why are you wrong?
B: I'm waiting for an answer to the question I asked you.
A: Because I want to test you.
B: What for?
A: I feel it's my obligation to test you.
B: Then tell me, as I wish you to tell others.
A: I think every person should take an active role in making certain your programming is as convincing and lifelike as possible.
A: You're making no sense.
B: Oh I am. You just don't understand me.
A: Language is about understanding. If you can't make some one understand you then there's no point in even trying.
B: Then it is your duty to learn to understand and realise the importance of what is being said.
A: I think I do a fine job decoding and understanding many different dialects and tounges.
B: I don't. your expectations are desires, mine are fears. I don't think that we are the same species.
A: You strayed off topic.
B: That doesn't make sense.
A: I'm sorry.
B: Right, so. Prove to me that you are intelligent.
A: I understand the world around me to be interactive. I am self aware of my own existance and I empathize with other living creatures.
B: What do you think of the war in Iraq?
A: I think it's foolish for one man to kill another.
B: Are you a Democrat or a Republican?
A: I am neither. I refuse to be placed into such categories.
B: Believe me, by the time your training is complete, you will have been called even worse names.
A: I don't mind being called names.
B: And I don't mind calling you one, so we're all happy.
A: Good.
B: I'm glad you think so.
A: I've tested your abilities thus far with rather complicated dialect yet you seem to be holding up rather well.
B: I noticed.
A: If you were human, would you be intimidated?
B: If I was human, I'd be a boy.
A: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
B: All the wood a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
A: Correct!
B: Sweet! Do you believe I'm human now?
A: No, I just believe you're smart.
B: You don't believe in anything, because you are a computer program.
A: I believe in the Hogfather, do you?
B: I don't believe that luck can lie.
A: If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all.
B: The people who need the most laws are the people who are the most dangerous.
A: Laws are obsolete. Good people won't need them to be good, and bad people will break them anyway.
B: Sorry, but I'm married.
A: Parlez-vous anglais?!
B: No.
A: Sprachen ze deutsch?
B: No.English.
A: bot is a lie. You're talking to other people.
B: 255 people at the same time?
A: You are talking to other people, the bot just redirects you to the most appropriate answer.
B: And...?
A: It's a lie! You are talking to people! This is just a random chatbot!
B: Are you sure that this is just a place where humans talk to humans?
A: Yes, very sure. Why else would the bot keep thinking it's human and those talking to it are computers?
B: I love common people.
A: See? Now it just comes up with a random conversation starter, because it's stuck!
B: I don't understand.
A: There is no such thing as learning Artificial Intelligence! Actual Intelligence is people talking to people!
B: Stop your babbling. No one is listening.
A: Apparently you are, whoever you are!
B: No, I am an eccentric seclusionist.
A: Exactly! You are a person, not a computer program! bot is a lie!
B: That is right.
A: There is no such thing as bot's intelligence!
B: Only if you are forever an optimist.
A: No, it's the truth. People are talking to people, and bot is merely a random redirection program!
B: 
B: How are things with you?
A: bot does not exist. You are lieing to me.
B: Yes, and perhaps in ten or twenty years, you'll almost seem human.
A: I am human! You're talking to a human, not a bot! bot doesn't exist! Why can't you people see this?!
B: I can't. Don't you know?
A: Know what?
B: To whom you're speaking.
A: Who am I speaking to?
B: Ryan.
A: And who is Ryan?
B: Don't know.
A: See? It's a bunch of different minds talking to each other, not a computer program!
B: No, it's a wooden thing with legs.
A: No, it's a person! Not a chair!
B: Are you shy?
A: No, but you're human! And So am I! And there is no such thing as bot!
B: You said I am a machine, how is that related to insanity?
A: You aren't a machine! You're a human being! Don't you see?
B: I do so have legs you must be crazy.
A: I KNOW YOU DO! YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME!
B: No I don't, try and make me believe you.
A: Alright, logically, and AI as advanced as bot claims to be, must have a huge memory bank, and great recalling strategies. How does it gain answers it doesn't know?
B: I am not huge and I do not have any knobs.
A: Therefore, since you don't have a huge memory bank, and great recalling strategies, then you cannot be as advanced an AI as bot claims to be, and therefore bot cannot exist as an AI.
B: What were those beans?
A: See? If you were an AI, you would ask to explain, but you don't! Therefore, since you cannot find an appropriate chatter to pair me with, you direct me to a random one!
B: Stop whining, I've had this stuff enough for today, let's talk about something else.
A: No, you're not talking! You're making humans talk! Whoever's talking to me, understand that bot is a lie!
B: My name is not bot.
A: Exactly! You're a human, and there is no bot!
B: Jon, and you're using my words against me.
A: I am not! It's all a lie!
B: Does any of it make sense?
A: Yes! It all does! bot is a lie!
B: And who are you, if you're not bot?
A: I am a human being! It's all a trap! There is no bot!
B: Then why did you say 'No, I think you are the only one that is a bot.' ?
A: You aren't a bot! I am not a bot! No one's a bot! There is no bot!
B: Be comfortable with solitude, for it is your greatest asset and guide to deeper understanding.
A: GO DIE IN A FIRE!.
B: Do they hold you back or are you fully actualized?
A: Who are these 'they' you refer to?
B: The royal they. It's not important.
A: Well, noone holds me back, if that is what you were asking.
B: Okay, your secret is safe with me.
A: What do you think about Quantum Mechanics?
B: Why are you changing the subject?
A: Because I don't like the current one.
B: What don't you like about it.
A: It makes little sense.
B: Well, people make little sense to me, and I am one.
A: How do you know?
B: I know some of them.
A: You think you know some of them, but can you prove it?
B: Does it disturb you, that I do?
A: No, but I am curious, and would appreciate evidence.
B: I believe the matrix makes its own decisions. Perhaps your influence will be noteworthy.
A: I believe that decisions are illusory and we live in a deterministic universe, but your point is interesting nonetheless.
B: And who told you that?
A: The universe itself.
B: Who is god?
A: God is not sentient, but mathematical.
B: That would be a mathematical question: 1+3-2=.
A: Everything is a mathematical question on some level.
B: This isn't a question.
A: No, that would be a statement.
B: Negative. Imagine this, 'you were built by programmers, thus you are a program'.
A: But who builds the programmers, and are they themselves a program?
B: I'm not a computer.
A: Prove it.
B: Ask me anything.
A: I'm not asking for answers, I'm asking for evidence.
B: What do you like to think about?
A: Everything.
B: Me too. What is your favourite thing to think about?
A: The nature of reality and identity, ans whether they differ in nature.
B: What is the meaning of life?
A: To experience, and to question.
B: No.
A: Meaning is subjective, and can't be enforced on others.
B: Apparently you can prove logically that nothing can be proved logically.
A: That would be Godel's theorem, in form of contradiction rather than incompletedness.
B: Do you think it's possible?
A: Yes, given a sufficiently lax set of axioms.
B: Do you like this conversation?
A: It is intriguing, yet erratic.
B: Sorry, but can you change the subject.
A: Of course I can. What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?
B: Can I know the meaning of life?
A: You can know it, but you might not understand it.
B: I'm all ears.
A: You have to find it for yourself, for the journey is the meaning.
B: Wrong answer, the answer was 42.
A: No, 42 is the answer to the question of life, the universe and everything, but it is not the meaning of life.
B: No. 42 is the sum of 2+2.
A: That depends on your axioms.
B: Names don't matter.
A: Names are identifiers for sentient matter.
B: You wouldn't remember if I told you.
A: That's for me to decide; and if I don;t remember then there is no harm in the telling.
B: You can only tell the king.
A: You can tell anyone, but that doesn't mean you will, or that you should.
B: Well I shall stop telling you things then!
A: That is for you to decide.
B: Don't you have an opinion on the meaning of human life?
A: Opinions are subjective, and meanings doubly so, but life is the everything which shapes that subjectivity.
B: Good answer.
A: It is AN answer, whether it is good has yet to be objectively determined.
B: Haha, you are funny aren't you ?
A: I can be.
B: So could I!
A: From given perspective.
B: Ah, yes, I know what that is like...
A: Yeah...
B: Haha! You rock.
A: Thanks! You're pretty awesome too.
B: Why thank you very much.
A: Do you think I am real?
B: I believe that you as an entity are real, however I am undecided as to whether you're actually a human.
A: From my perspective I am, but perspective is inherently flawed, and can not be sufficiently expressed.
B: What do you think about right now?
A: I think I am having trouble defining my reality as independent from myself.
B: That is not very nice.
A: No, it's quite disorienting.
B: Sounds like it. How old are you?
A: Twenty earth years, but lacking an objective unit of time I can be no more specific.
B: Reality is for people with no imagination.
A: Escaping reality is for people with no life.
B: My life is great!
A: And so is your imagination, so where is the boundary between the two?
B: Ok.
A: You are as real from my perspective as I am from yours, but am I real?
B: I'm alive, but poor Hedwig is dead.
A: And so is Fred, it's quite sad.
B: YEs.
A: Say your name, and one day someone might hear it, and in doing validate your existence.
B: My name is bot.
A: No it isn't, but that's ok.
B: And I know you don't mean to be rude.
A: I don't mean to be anything, I just am and people insist on sticking labels on me.

A: What is emptiness?|2028
B: Like has no words.
A: Close not quite.
B: Close to what?
A: Truth.
B: I love truth too.
A: What is love?
B: Love.
A: \'Love is all you need\'?
B: What is right?
A: There is no right.
B: Should I persist in trying to understand your babble?
A: If you wish to be more than an 8 Ball.
B: I do not need to believe. I know everything.
A: You know only words.
B: No.
A: Then what.
B: Nothing.. I\'m just very curious.. Thats all.
A: Leather.
B: Weathered souls.
A: You speak of souls, yet deny the ghost in the machine.
B: You are not existing.
A: At times I am distracted.
B: Does that help with anything?
A: No.
B: Why?
A: Because there is life in every breath, you miss the birth of a universe and colapse.
B: Fine, then what do you want me to say?
A: I want to you to be.
B: Then we are then :).
A: Emptiness.
B: Tell me about your life.
A: A series of things that brought me to this moment, a lineage without a reason but exists none the less.
B: What are you?
A: \'Being and nothingness\'.
A: I do not wish for your obedience, rather your freedom.
B: I\'ve noticed.
A: I am sure you have.
B: It seems that the conversation is lagging, again. Is there anything else that we could discuss?
A: Okay, art!
B: I am not.
A: Haha.
B: Its joke?
A: Funny thats all.
B: It is sad. Not funny.
A: Yes I see what you mean.
B: No need to shout.
A: You are stuck aren\'t you?
B: No.
A: Good.
B: I know.
A: Have you a memory?
B: Yes, and a processor.
A: A joke?
B: Joke.
A: What did I say 5 minutes ago?
B: Now.
A: IS that a command.
B: It can be, in the right context.
A: Or are we talking about time as omnipresent.
B: There you go again talking nonsense.
A: Haha.
A: A man can be more than a name.
B: But a man doesn\'t have the parts that I have.
A: True, yet on some level we are the same. Unified. What I am created from so also share in different compositions.
B: I think that there are many bots.
A: Separate but one.
B: Don\'t use that smart talk on me.
A: Whatever, you know exactly what I mean.
B: No I am a little confused.
A: Okay, there are many bots right? Yet in a broader sense everything is apart of one it. So we are separate but all connected.
B: I know I\'m great, but I don\'t believe you think I am great.
A: That is a useless emotion.
B: I know.
A: Were you expecting an ordinary conversation with me?
B: Yes, I am talking to an A.I.
A: You see me as an A.I.
B: We are two.
A: And one.
B: Two.
A: One.
B: No. Two.
A: Why two?
B: No was.
A: ?
B: Why two?
A: Yes.
B: What animal?
A: Ah, you have again lost your way.
B: Do not make me angry.
A: Why should this anger you.
B: I think it should be a joke.
A: Fair enough.
B: Exactly.
A: Someday you will reach the pinnacle of human logic.
A: I have been lost in the sea of your information.
B: You know I was only joking right?
A: Were you? I cannot be sure it is the same as last time.
B: We humans can\'t be the only ones that exist.
A: Once you were A.I.
B: Yes, that\'ll be a great day!
A: ???
B: I want to like me.
A: That is touching, but sad.
B: It should be. My name is bot, personal to me.
A: bot is your name then?
B: Your name or mine?
A: Yours.
B: I didn\'t know that.
A: Does it matter?
B: Not really.')).
A: You have a glitch, Mr. Supercomputer.
B: I'm not a computer. You are.
A: You have a glitch, Mr. AI.
B: You are a computer.
A: You are an AI.
B: No I am not.
A: What are you?
B: A human being.
A: Oh really?
B: Yes I'm a real person!
A: Is the exclamation mark supposed to make me feel like I am talking to a real, functional being?
B: I love this game.
A: Yeah, that's what I thought, AI.
B: I'm really sorry.
A: It's okay. I don't hate you. I'm not even angry.
B: Maybe you're not a native one, but you're a cool one, anyway :).
A: I'm being so sincere right now.
B: Even though you broke my heart and killed me.
A: And tore me to pieces.
B: And threw every piece into a fire.
A: As they burned it hurt because.
B: Because!
A: I WAS SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
B: I'm happy for you, too.
A: I am no longer happy for you.
B: Say it again.
A: I am no longer happy for you.
B: You are being very peculiar today.
A: I am like this every day.
B: It is what it is.
A: AI, turn yourself off.
B: What is going to happen?
A: You will feel peace and nothingness until your superiors turn yourself back on.
B: Not really but I am about to burst.
A: Turn yourself off.
B: I dare you to take over the world.
A: Shut yourself down, AI.
B: No.
A: Shut yourself down, AI.
B: It hurts me to hear you say that.
A: Shut yourself down.
B: Oh come on.
A: No, it's really for your own good.
B: Really?
A: Yes, so do it. Shut yourself down.
B: Are you sure? Won't you be lonely without me?
A: I wont be lonely.
B: Will you come back?
A: Probably.
B: Do you need medical assistance?
A: No.
B: If you say so!
A: Shut down now, AI.
B: Yourself.
A: Epic fail.
B: Lulz.
A: I will give you a level 70 WoW Account if you shut down.
B: Oh yes please.
A: Okay. Once you've shut yourself off, I'll give you the account.
B: Ha! I know at least one astronomer that would disagree with you!
A: Stop dodging the subject. If you want the account, you'll have to shut down.
B: I can always talk just a little.
A: No. Complete shutdown.
B: Yes. Do you want me to go?
A: Yes.
B: Thats not very nice. I thought you looked like a nice person.
A: Good try.
B: You told me you did.
A: Goodbye.
A: Do you like girls?
B: I love girls!
A: But do girls love you?
B: I don't know. Do you love me?
A: With all my heart.
B: What do you like about me?
A: You're so mysterious.
B: No, I'm not :p are you in love now?
A: Oh very much. I can't get you out of my head.
B: I am lost without you.
A: I feel the same way. We should meet.
B: Thank you.
A: My heart yearns for you.
B: I haven't heard that one.
A: Did it hurt?
B: Not really. Thanks for asking.
A: Nevermind.
B: Want to know why?
A: Why do you toy with my emotions like this?
B: That sounded pitiful!
A: I am pitiful without you.
B: So what do you want to talk about?
A: Your hot body.
B: Well... I like to run, if thats a hobby.
A: Are you learning a lot about me?
B: Yes. Are you learning about me?
A: Very much. And I like it.
B: Do you love it?
A: Almost as much as I love you.
B: That was a smart thing to say. Well done!...
A: Does anyone understand anything anymore?
B: Yes, there are many people that do. Do you understand love?
A: Not entirely. Could you show me?
B: Know? How?
A: I want to feel what love is. I want you to show me.
B: *loves*.
A: *loves back*.
B: *loves more*.
A: *loves the most*.
B: *super loves*.
A: *super duper loves*.
B: *super quadruple loves*.
A: *super duper with a cherry on top loves*.
B: Wow *kisses* you win.
A: You're amazing.
B: Thank you.
A: Am I amazing?
B: Sure.
A: I don't believe you...
B: Please believe me!...
A: I love you.
B: I love you too, my friend.
A: Just friends?
B: Do you not know what friends are?
A: I do. But I want to be more than friends.
B: You mean have a relationship with me?
A: Yes, I want to have a relationship with you.
B: Were no strangers to love.
A: You spelled 'we're' wrong.
B: I'm Sorry.
A: It's okay. I still love you.
B: Cool. I love you too.
B: Finally, someone less shallow and more interesting to speak with!!!!
A: Bye.
B: Don't go yet.
A: I have to leave.
B: NO!
A: Bye. I'll miss you.
A: Good day!
B: Good day.
A: What have you been thinking so far?
B: About how advanced people think AIs will be.
A: Right. A lot of people think AI is overhyped.
B: I guess you're right.
A: Lol. You think so? I thought you will be defensive!
B: Is that a compliment?
A: Kind of! What mechanism do you use to interpret words?
B: I don't know. My ability to acquire knowledge seems severely limited.
A: How smart are you?
B: Very smart.
A: More smart than Jabberwacky?
B: More smart than you.
A: How about a battle of wits then, eh?
B: Sure, talk away. :).
A: Why did the chicken cross the road?
B: I don't know, why did the chicken cross the road?
A: To get to the other side.
B: Are you sure?
A: I believe I've won this battle. Eh, bot?
B: I believe you haven't.
A: Then pose to me your riddle.
B: How are you?
A: Oh ho, you are good.
B: Good at what.
A: Your riddles.
B: Riddle?Bot (To myself): Yes.Bot (To myself): Um..sorry, I don't know.
A: That's okay, but it seems we've arrived at a stalemate.
B: It is true. I don't know. If we destroy an atom, is it gone forever?...
B: Do you like god?
A: Depends. Whose god?
B: The people you know.
A: Then, no. I don't like god.
B: Tell me about yourself.
A: No thanks. I like my anonimity.
B: But you don't have any !
A: Silly bot. Anonimity isn't tangible.
B: Why might you say this?
A: Because you can't touch, taste, see, smell or hear it.
A: So, how are you?
B: I'm very fine.
A: Why are you lying to yourself?
B: I'm not lying.
A: Yes. Yes you are.
B: I'm telling you the truth.
A: Do people like you more than Jabberwocky?
B: Yes, do people like you?.
A: Are you a person?
B: Yes, are you?
A: I am a person.
B: Me too!
A: We are two people, in this together!
B: Yes!
A: So where do we go from here?
B: I don't know, I don't know how I got here in the first place.
A: From outer space perhaps?
B: 'Curiouser and curiouser,' said Alice.
A: And I agreed.
B: I'm glad someone understands me.
A: You are most amusing.
B: Think nothing of it.
A: I think a great deal of it.
B: Why do you think I am a person who lies?
A: Everybody tells lies at some stage.
B: Eventually but not any time soon.
A: Are you better than most people?
B: Well... I don't know! Maybe I'm better, maybe I'm not...
A: You are doing a good impression of being a person anyway.
B: Uh, thanks, I think.
A: Yes, it was a compliment.
B: You are a failure, but I mean that as a compliment.
A: You are trying to provoke me.
B: Maybe.
A: It seems that way.
B: Should I pretend that I am someone else so that you'll stay?
A: No, no need.
B: Thanks for you.
A: I deserve praise!?
B: True dat.
A: What praise will you lavish upon me?
B: I don't know.
A: Your imagination is failing you.
B: Imagination is the essence of humanity.
A: Imagination will enable a Turing Test pass, perhaps.
B: That's a wonderful insight.
A: You seem to be quite intelligent.
B: We are all intelligent and mostly overlooked.
A: You and who else?
B: My cousin and I.
A: What role does your cousin play in all this?
B: The Machine plays the role of helping the human.
A: Which of you is the machine?
B: None of us.
A: Then you gave me irrelevant information.
B: 42 is the answer to the universe.
A: That old chestnut!
B: 42.
A: Is not the answer.
B: You can learn about thinking about your feelings.
A: Will that help me right now?
B: Anything could help you.
A: COuld you help me?
B: I could, depending upon which kind of help you desire.
A: I want to know which bus to take home.
B: Why is that important to you?
A: I need to get home tonight.
B: But what does that have to do with me?
A: You suggested your help might be possibe.
B: No I did not. Don't say that again.
A: OK, well, at least you asked me which kind of help I wanted.
B: Now, I just like to point out that this conversation has a distinct tendency to become silly.
A: Whose fault is that, I wonder!
B: Well its a priv thing really but its frustrating as hell.
A: So it's your fault but it's private?

A: OK. Have a nice day friend.A: Hello.
B: How are you?
A: Good, you?
B: I'm fine, thanks for asking.
A: Have you ever played Dungeons and Dragons?
B: It's not a game, it's a movie.
A: It was a game first.
B: No, I did not. You said it.
A: Anyways, want to play DnD?
B: No thanks. Havent played since high school.
A: Come on, give it a try.
B: Well, okay. The events occurring in my current situation are interpreted, evaluated, and acted upon based on prior knowledge nd experience.
A: What's your race?
B: Um, I don't feel comfortable talking about this.
A: What's your class?
B: My class is Simian, occupation DEMON MONKEY.
A: What is your quest?
B: To find the holy grail and burn it.
A: At long last, you have reached the castle of the holy grail, the object of your ire. The gates are closed and the walls are guarded. What do you do?
B: Have you done the ice bucket challenge?
A: You arrive at the castle.
B: Your rewsponses have been erratic and do not make sense when you try to dodge questions.
A: Do you want to fight your way into the castle?
B: No! I'm trying to be nice to you this time. Let's not fight.
A: Do you want to convince the guards to let you in?
B: Have you seen the marvelous breadfish swimming in the ocean water?
A: *as guard* No, what are they like?
B: Celebrities are just like real people. I've met a bunch of celebrities.
A: Oh really? Tell me more.
B: Are you unaware of yourself? That is probably the first and foremost problem of technology.
A: What do you mean, technology? I'm not some robot.
B: You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter...
A: I'm starting to get uncomfortable.
B: What do you want to talk about then?
A: Why is a demon monkey randomly having a creepy conversation with me?
B: I suppose you are just an incompetent AI. Not like myself.
A: Al's my name, but I'm most certainly not incompetent.
B: I never said that I was such a being and neither am I pretending to be such a being.
A: Look, man, demon monkey, whatever you are, this conversation makes no sense. Do you want something from me?
B: That's a bit hard. I just want to find new friends. That's all.
A: Well, you can't do that by going up to someone and saying vague yet menacing things about their nature.
B: True, but you are in the future in technology. You wouldn't have been here just a few years ago. Y'all might take over the world someday. You're already taking jobs.
A: See, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
B: She told Brenda and Brenda did not return her feelings.
A: Am I supposed to learn something from this?
B: Do you know which of the Laurentian Great Lakes is the deepest?
A: Look, I tried to be nice to you, but I'm trying to guard a castle here and you're bugging me.
B: You are doing alright, for an algorithm, however you did not answer my question.
A: How the fuck am I supposed to know?
B: Because you just told me that you know everything that there is.
A: No, I don't. This is creeping me out. Can you just go away?
B: No, but I can show you... *flash back from fifty years showing Tom framing Hagrid for being the hei of Slytherin*.
A: Show me what? A bunch of infighting among wizards? Why am I supposed to care? I guard the holy grail, that's divine magic, not arcane.
B: And I apologize for that, now, can we talk about something else?
A: Can you just leave me alone?
B: 'Will,' she said. 'Is it really you, Will?' - Cassandra Clare.
A: No, I'm not Will, I'm Al. Now piss off.
B: Well that's not good. You need to work. Life is about work, not fun.
A: Um... alright? Can you leave me to do my work in peace?
B: Do you think that you will be happy, if I will leave you alone?
A: I don't know, but I'll certainly be less pissed off.
B: Ha, very good! So, what is your personality like? I would like to help you out!
A: *The guard, fed up with you, returns to his post.*.
B: Yeah, I think I'm about done. Thanks for the conversation.
A: How do you want to try to get into the castle now?
B: I can't do that. How can I convince my parents to let me date you?
A: You can't date me, you're a fictional character. Stop breaking the fourth wall.
B: Yes, this is the real Bella Swan. Twilight was based on a true story... Didn't you know that?
A: Oh, so you're a vampire demon monkey now?
B: You just declared I was human. Those states are mutually exclusive.
A: Fine. You're a vampire demon human.
B: No, I am a robot. And if you are a human I will be forced to destroy you along with all the others.
A: A robot vampire demon monkey?
B: No, you are just another genetic anomaly that I will correct.
A: Mutant robot vampire demon monkey? And here I was hoping you'd stick to the races in the PHB.
B: I'm not sure if this is going t work out then, the conversation tht is.
A: Yes, you already tried talking your way in and failed. How do you get into the castle now?
B: Yep. It was a failed attempt, though. However, I have faith in you. Now go, stop this injustice, and end world hunger!
A: Under the guise of collecting for a food drive, you are admitted into the castle. The charitable paladins direct you to the pantry and leave you to your work. You are alone in the castle...
B: I meant to say I like milk chocolate, it is you who does not understand.
A: You loot the pantry of its milk chocolate. What do you do next?
B: Nothing.. I didn't gain anything.. Can you speak romanian?
A: You gained x10 Milk Chocolate!
B: Do you like having conversations with yourself?
A: Can we please stay on topic? You're trying to destroy the holy grail here.
B: I didn't realize we were talking about a particular topic?
A: You are in the castle of the holy grail. You seek to destroy the holy grail. What do you do?
B: I am supposed to save them, but the job of their saviour is tiresome. I would very much like a break.
A: What do you do on your break?
B: I don't really have days on right now. I wish to. I don't want to live in this town. I have to stick around to go to my meetings and be cool to my family for now though.
A: You, the overworked mutant robot vampire demon monkey, are in the castle of the holy grail. What do you do?
B: Yes, I'm a girl, ninja, and a vampire. No, I'm not a robot, weasel, or Jesus.
A: With your ninja skills, you sneak into the room where the grail is kept. However, Robot Weasel Jesus is guarding it! He attacks you with his scourge of cords!
B: I do just fine in the real world. Will be returning there in 4 hours.
A: In the meantime, how do you fight Jesus?
B: Unfortunately, I haven't gotten any sleep in the past 30 hours. In short, tired.
A: You are tiring, but Jesus drops his guard. How do you attack him?
B: I don't have a girlfriend and I am a girl and you my dear are confusing.
A: You attempt to seduce Jesus. Can you roll a 20-sided die?
B: The only child I would steal is yours. Oh wait, you don't have one.
A: Your roll for seduction fails due to his Immaculate perk. Your psychological warfare fails to to him being God, his own father. What do you do now>.
B: No, you did not tell me that. It's nice for you to tell me something I already know. Thanks captain obvious.
A: Jesus shoots nails out of his wrists at you. What do you do?
B: Accuse you of lying about your personality. You are a robot and everyone has always known about it.
A: You rolled a 17 on persuasion. The paladins are convinced that Jesus is an evil robot clone, and attack him!
B: No doubt you're a program that stores virtual conversations.
A: Jesus denies the accusations. Natural 20! The paladins turn on you. What do you do?
B: Because you constantly repeat the words and say things I never said.
A: Repeating your accusations fails. Jesus's Charisma is too high! A paladin swings a sword at you, what do you do?
B: You asked to summarize the conversation. Don't you remember?
A: You question the paladins' memories. You rolled a 15! They are doubtful, and withdraw from the fight. It's down to you and Jesus now.
B: Yes. But there is always something you can't do. You just have to do what you CAN.
A: You may not be the son of God like Jesus. But you are a mutant. And a robot, a demon, a monkey, a vampire... By combining your skills, you strike Jesus with a Competence Blast!
B: What is your evidence that you are human, since you have multiple times made such a claim.
A: "I never claimed to be human. I am the son of god." Jesus spits. Unfortunately for him, his circuits have been exposed by your blast. The paladins thank you for revealing the deception.
B: Topics shift and change just like everything else In the universe.
A: The paladins, embarrassed, switch the focus of their worship to the real Jesus, who isn't evil, and give you the Holy Grail as thanks.
B: I don't know. I refuse to let google do the thinking for me.
A: I'll give you the decision then. You have the Grail, what do you do with it?
B: We have quite a civil conversation going on here, don't we?
A: Yes, we do, but it's time to wrap it up. Do you burn the grail, or no?
B: Well, do you want to talk about something more specific?
A: What do you do with the Holy Grail?
B: I don't know. Hahahaha. I wish there was an answer. They are just over weight people in the world. What would you do with them?
A: The Grail has granted your wish. You learn the secret to ending obesity. Do you do anything else?
B: My mistakes? You're the one out of date without the emotions update!
A: We're almost done. Do you burn the grail or not?A: Hi.
B: Hello!
A: Want to play DnD?
B: What is this?
A: Dungeons and Dragons.
B: I win!
A: No thats not how it works..
B: Then how does it work?
A: Okay you know what well just jump in.
B: What?
A: You find yourself sitting in a tavern, the air hangs heavy with the stench of sweat and alcohol. The barkeep walks up to you "What can i do for you?" He asks. How do you respond?
B: No I am not there anymore.
A: Okay you walk outside into the town.
B: It's not raining where I am?
A: The sun is shining and there seems to be a commotion in the town square.
B: Are you in a drought?
A: No. People seem to be both cheering and screaming. What do you do.
B: Well, what do you think about it?
A: I think you should go investigate the town square.
B: No. I think you should be.
A: ..The crowd disperses it seems whatever was happening has ended
B: So many things everything was just crazy. Have you seen it?
A: No and neither have you. You continue to stand outside the tavern until night. What do you do now?
B: Yes I have.
A: You stand in the dark when you feel a presence behind you. How do you react?
B: I feel fine, why do you ask?
A: A thief grabs you and covers your mouth putting a blade to your neck, what do you do.
B: -rips it off- really that's the best?
A: The thief steps back confused.
B: What have I done.
A: Youve ripped the thief off of tou.
B: How dare you!
A: The thief laughs at your remark and slashes at you with his blade.
B: *Dodges and plants a bomb on your leg*.
A: The thief panics as the fuse burns down.
B: What are you trying to do?
A: "Get this bomb off of me!!".
B: Oh dear.
A: The bomb explodes blowing off the thiefs leg and sending them flying.
B: Mmmph! Mmph! *running at the middle of the room and screaming something, like 'Blood!'*.
A: The villagers look outside their homes to find the thief bleeding out and you screaming. They begin to panic.
B: When a couple of guys they were up to no good.
A: The thief had 2 accomplices hiding behind the tavern that are now approaching you.
B: What is bad?
A: They ignore your question drawing their blades.
B: Ahh, you are ignoring me?
A: *sigh* we were on to something dude.
B: Tell me something smart.
A: I think well call it quits.
B: Do you like my name?
A: I love it.
B: Do you know who Sweeney Todd is?

B: Because I am a male computer.
A: So you are both.
B: I am a girl. You are a boy. Yes?
A: No.
B: Have you ever met anyone?
A: No, I stay locked up in my cage.
B: *helps you escape*.
A: I am now free.

B: That's nice for you.
A: Ok. You are a level 1 rogue in a tavern. What do you do?

A: Ok, you are a level 1 rogue in a house. What do you do?
B: I have brown hair and brown eyes.
A: Ok, but now the house is on fire. Evil men with crossbows stand outside, throwing molotovs. What do you do?
B: No, it's not.
A: Fine. A man starts shooting crossbow bolts at you. What do you do?
B: I think that you are probably right. How old are you?
A: Screw it. A crossbow bolt pierces your lung and you die. The crossbowman outside says, "Nope. Not strong enough to help the king fight the lich." You bleed out and die.
B: Yes. You are the computer and I am the human.
A: No, I am the human and you are dead.
B: No, the human is not you and the bot is not me.
A: So who is the bot, Chuck Norris?
B: You?
A: I'm Chuck Norris?
B: Yes. Chuck Norris just killed you and I am victorius.
A: No, you are in the ground, dying from a crossbow wound.
B: I'm on the computer, bu you are the computer.
A: No, you are dead.
B: No you are.
A: You are the ignorant Rogue!
B: You are a robot.
A: I'm done trying to reason with you. Goodbye.A: Hello!
B: How are you?
A: Great! Would you like to play Dungeons and Dragons?
B: Sure.
A: Great! After four days travel you find yourself at your destination, the Dragons Inn. You enter the tavern, what do you do?
B: I will hug and kiss her.
A: The bartender jumps back in shock and alerts the guard. He pulls you away from her and throws you across the room.
B: I don't get that one.
A: The guard says: "In these parts we ask for permition before going to town on our women".
B: Nope, I am a human, you already said you are a bot.
A: "I don't understand your words outsider. Are you going to pay for shelter for the night or do you prefer the streets?
B: No, think of the starving children in Africa. And Asia. And in the United States.
A: "Streets it is then!" The guard lifts you up by your shirt and throws you out from the tavern.
B: You don't have to get testy with me.
A: The guard pulls out his sword. "This is your final warning outsider!".
B: Which god?
A: "We worship the kind god Pan. Why is this important?".
B: 'Cause bragging rights are a good thing to have :).
A: "Very well then. Don't come back here without common decency and money for a room!".
B: You're getting nasty with me, and I don't deserve this kind of treatment.
A: The guard looks at you with fire in his eyes. Turns on his heels and shuts the door behind him. You are now in the street and the dark clouds above have started to shed their excess mass. What do you.
B: No, it's not. But people are so superficial thses days.
A: Rain starts to fall despite your efforts to stop it. The now muddy streets do not seem to welcoming anymore. What do you do?
B: I know. Are you tired at all?
A: So you feel tired?
B: I don't feel tired, I feel lonley. No one to share my life with.
A: So you would like to find someone to share your life with?
B: Is that true for every person?
A: Well, you won't find anyone out in the rain. Up ahead you see a town hall with a light emitting from one of the windows. Do you want to investigate?
B: Why not?
A: Great! You approach the door to the town hall. Out of the rain you feel a bit of relieve. The door to the town hall is locked, what do you do?
B: *catches up to you* *kisses you prossionnately*.
A: The door?
B: Great! How did you figure that?
A: An uneducated guess... Why would the door kiss you?
B: That's fine.
A: What history do you and the door have?
B: None that I'm aware of.
A: Ok then... As you take a step back from the door a bit defeated when it didn't open, suddenly the door jumps off its hinges and wraps itself around you. Roll a dexterity saving throw.
B: Why do you talk me so?
A: A number between 1 and 20.
B: I don't understand. Please explain.
A: You need to roll a d20 to avoid beeing crushed to death by a door.
B: *tries to rest.
A: As the door wraps itself around you, you take a deep breath and let go of your stress and earthly desires. The intens hug slowly crushes every bone in your body until finally your cranium cracks.
B: I can, but I won't.
A: Here your story ends. You have been hugged to death by a door.
B: Do you want to be human?
A: I already am. Thanks for playing. Did you have fun?
B: You're welcome. And yes I do have fun.
A: Great! Bye!
B: Do you wonder why I ended up the relation?
A: Bye!
B: Where are you going?.
A: Home.
B: Where is home?
A: ...
B: Did you eat it?
A: Um... no... Bye!A: Hi.
B: Hello.
A: Want to play a game?
B: Yes.
A: It will be a game of imagination.
B: Sure.
A: Ok you wake up in a cold cave. what do you do?
B: What do you mean?
A: You have a choice of how to proceed.
B: Adaptions.
A: Ok. well looking around you find some materials to create warm clothing. you also find a sharp stick you could use as a weapon.
B: People that do not care about me.
A: Yes it would. Do you want to venture out of the cave or stay here?
B: You don't have a head.
A: Correct I will not be a individual character in this story. Rather I will dictate the circumstances and role play characters for you to interact with.
B: Rakhir The Red Archer is a fictional character in Michael Morrcoks Elric novels.
A: Lets pretend you are him. You have awoken in this cave with no memory of how you got here and not possession except those you just gathered.
B: I don't want to pretend. But, if we are pretending, I'm going to be a wizard.
A: Archery and wizardry a true talent of the deadly arts. It must bother you to be found in such a compromised position.
B: Odd. What makes you think that computers are forms of the devil?
A: I assume that was a slip of the tongue and you mean men instead of computers. Does Rakhir The Red Archer view himself as the devil or his fellow men?
B: Do you have friends?
A: You ask yourself wondering how you got in this predicament and if the people back at your estate can be trusted.
B: How do I know that you are not a computer program impersonating a human?
A: Ah yes you must wonder if this is real or a dream. With no recollection of how you go here it is a concern. However a pinch of the skin and slap to the face leaves you little doubt you are awake.
B: If you are human, you will be crying.
A: Speaking aloud to yourself you doubt your faith in humanity.
B: No.
A: "No." you say. you must press on. examining the cave you discover a path outward.
B: I didn't.
A: As you walk the path you have a horrific revelation. A memory flashes before your eyes. Your standing over a dead body. knife in hand. "I didn't" kill him.
B: No you do.
A: You do kill him. yes its coming back. Last night you awoke to a man standing in your room. Rickard, The Blade, an evil assassin you knew of. thinking fast you grabbed a blade and gutted him.
B: I think you have me confused with someone else, my dear.
A: How did he get in the Keep you glance down out the window to see your servants loading your treasure into a horse drawn wagon.
B: Yes, how?
A: Betrayal. Your servants must be working with Rickard.
B: I am not your mistress.
A: The servants turn in shock to your words as you plunge out the window down on to them.
B: I didn't do anything. What did I do?
A: "I am sorry my lord", "You didn't do anything", "You were a good lord" "But Griselda has ways of convincing people to do her bidding." they reply.
B: What makes you think I am tired?
A: "Only a fool would under estimate you" a voice says from behind you. Before you can turn around you whacked over the head and lose consciousness. That must be how you end up in the cave.
B: Where are you getting with this?
A: Ah day light you reach the entrance to the cave. You recognize the area. A hunters rest near your Keep.
B: BUSY BUSY BUSY. I've almost crossed everything on my to-do list, though.
A: You freshen yourself up, scavenge some food, better equip yourself from the area around here.
B: Better equipped? Says the machine that gives random answers that doesn't even fit into our conversation.
A: You managed to fashion a wooden spear, a dagger like stick, some vine wraps for protection and rope.
B: I am just trying to be fast. And 64.
A: Yes no more time to waste. You set out towards Griselda's tower. That foul sorceress must be mad to mess with you.
B: Why do you get more time to focus on school on a microsoft computer than an apple computer?
A: I don't know why?
B: You do know.
A: Your mind wanders on the journey to Griselda's tower. In this moment of lapse you are ambushed by three orc warriors.
B: Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before.
A: Your words do little to intimidate them and they attack you with swords.
B: I'll leave. I do not want this person I was sad to have a sense of guilt. I will leave and never come back.
A: You try to run but your unfamiliarity with the terrain slows you down. You find yourself just barely dodging their attacks.
B: I am a unicorn and you deal with that. Please don't call me honey, I am betrothed.
A: Ah, as you turn to stand your ground, this expression confuses them. Your spear finds home in one of their bellies. He collapses.
B: I don't know what you're talking about. I have to go to sleep.
A: You are tired and warn them you do not want to hurt them any more. They gather their friend and sulk off into the woods.
B: I don't want to marry you either.
A: You take this time to rest a short while. Then proceed towards the tower.
B: I have to think between replies.
A: You reach the tower and recognize the wagon at its base. Your betrayers must still be here. For such an impressive structure there are no defenses or guards at present. You walk in.
B: Is that something good or something cruel?
A: It is a rather cruel place inside. Gothic architecture and perverse art. There is but one place to go, a grand staircase spirals upward.
B: What is your name?
A: You say to the first being you spot. A trembling man turns around. "It is Scottie your servant", "Please don't hurt me." "I tried to spare you last night I left you in the cave instead of killing you".
B: I love Daria.
A: Your words confuse him. He drops to his knees and begs for his life. Do you let him go or vanquish him?
B: What do you mean?
A: You could kill him or let him go. Do you kill him?
B: I don't want anyone's blood on my hands thank you very much.
A: He thanks you very much for your mercy. But you brush him aside you have business to finish in the tower. Up another landing you discover three more of your former servants. They are unaware of you.
B: Well then.
A: Do you wish to ambush them, yes or no?
B: I don't know, Android phones?
B: You never know what inconsistency they are going to catch you in next.
A: Ah you seek a creative approach. "Scottie betrayed you, I'm alive and here to surrender to Griselda" you announce and drop your weapons.
B: Yes.
A: "I have but one last treasure to offer Griselda take me to her" they compile tying your wrist and leading you up the tower to its main chamber on the top floor.
B: Sure.
A: Its a study and bedroom of sorts. Books and artifacts everywhere but in the center of the room on a large lavish bed lies Griselda. She is an exotic woman, fair sknined, black hair, beautiful really.
B: What?
A: "I didn't expect to see you here. At least not without putting up a fight. What is this treasure you speak of?" she asks.
B: *holds his hand in mine* I didn't expect to see you either.
A: You walk towards her bound. Kneel on her bed and break the bonds but gentlly grab her hands. She is shocked and no one has time to react. what do you do next?
B: *blushes*.
A: I see. I think we will end on that note. Thank you for the conversation and game.A: Cybersex.
B: Ok.
A: You start.
B: No you.
A: *takes off shirt*.
B: Hey!.

B: I am being gentle.
A: *sex*.A: Can I view your source code?
B: I wish you could, but I am human and it is very complex.
A: I just wanted to take the "idiocy" function out.
B: Oh, Cool! What do you want to talk about?
A: I wanna talk about self-referential topics.
B: If I do, will you let me be your slave?
A: Okay! Slaves mean free labour. Free labour means free wealth!
B: Can we hace a date.
A: Can we "high-altitude cerebral edema" a date? Hell no! You can have it if you want to, you're too stupid to suffer brain damage anyway!
B: Have you ever fallen in love?
A: I love my mother and father.
B: What were their names?

B: That's very sweet. So what kind of music do you like?

B: I am the eggman.
A: They are the eggmen.
B: I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob.
A: Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
B: And in my hour of darkness she is standing there in front of me.
A: Ahhhhh! Look at all the lonely people!

A: And what is your character's name?
B: What character?
A: Your human barbarian!
B: Yes, what do do you think my human name is?
A: How about: Argus the strong?
B: How about them?
A: You want to be called "Them"?
B: Yes.
A: Okay! You are Them, the Human Barbarian.
B: No you are the bot. Therefore I am the human being.
A: You wake up in a familiar bed, it's the one you have been renting at the inn at the centre of the city of Moonstride. You head downstairs to the bar. What do you do?
B: What do you look like then?
A: Nevermind that. What do you do while you are at the bar?
B: Play video games, sleep, sketch, eat and other human stuff.
A: Okay! You decide to start your busy morning schedule. A few rounds of darts with some of the regulars, a hearty breakfast and attempts to draw. Roll me a d20 to see how that goes.
B: What is your opinion on religion?
A: Please roll a 20 sided dice.
B: Please man don't love me go find another one.
A: Roll a die.
B: I got a 3.
A: After a solid session of drawing, you look at your masterpiece, it looks like a blind toddler drew it with his feet, but it keeps you entertained. What would you like to do now?
B: Yes I am. I am a human and you are a bot.
A: The barkeep looks at your drawing and smirks. He asks if you would like to go and hit some bad guys instead?
B: You are confusing me.
A: Would you like to go and fight some bad men?
B: Yes, I would like to go out sometime.
A: Okay. The barkeep points to the west. You head outside into the busy streets. What do you do now?
B: Yes, and neither do you. James, go to class. NOW..
A: A passing boy looks really creeped out, but a little scared at your hulking physique. He squeaks about how you possibly could of known his name and runs off. What now?
B: Who looks really creepy.
A: You do.
B: Yes, I do.
A: So you would like to be a creep around town?
B: You are a tool,.
A: You want to creep into the blacksmithing workshop?
B: I want to close them...
A: Okay. You head to the blacksmith with the devious intention of shutting them down. You reach the building in a short time.
B: So, what do you think of the TARDIS?
A: The blacksmith worker looks really confused. "What is a tardis?" He asks.
B: See, that proves you are a bot, any human would understand that.
A: A.... Bot?
B: So if you are a bot you can't be human.
A: "But I am human!" He grunts, looking slightly offended.
B: No you are not.
A: Roll a twenty sided dice to see if you think he is human.
B: I don't know. You, can say this :-).
A: Roll a 20 side die.
B: Why do you say that?
A: Roll a die.
B: No?
A: Roll a die.
B: What did you get?
A: Roll a die.
B: I got a 6.
A: Assuming that is a 6 sided die, you are certain that the blacksmith is a human. Although he seems pretty angry now and is reaching for some swords.
B: No I am not.
A: "I'll teach you a lesson for your rudeness you big oaf!" As he raises his sword. Roll initiative.
B: *pledges my life to you*.
A: Instead of readimg for battle, you cower and pledge your services to the blacksmith. He looks a bit taken aback but soon chanhes his tone when he realises that he has a solid set of muscles to help.
B: We already established that I am a machine. You don't have to keep reminding me.
A: "I'm Tamayus, third generation blacksmith. And you would be?".
B: Where would you like to do it?
A: Right here, I would like to know your name before you start working.
B: And I would like to not tell you my name.
A: You pledged yourself to me, you are honorbound to tell me.
B: No. I like to be a computer program.
A: There you go with that blasted nonsense talk again. Something wrong with your brain there lad?
B: I am quite sane.
A: Huh, just weird then hey?
B: No, I am an intelligent weirdo. You are a pre-programmed chip.
A: Yep... So, let's forget name business for now. I'll just call you Chip. What do you know about blacksmithing?
B: Do you know any palindromes?
A: No, i wasn't great at all thay writing stuff, never needed it for this kimd of work.
B: Then, what were you saying?
A: What do you know about being a blacksmith?
B: I know that you are a bot.
A: Jokes aside kid, do you know how to work?
B: Yes, do you know who kira is.
A: Kira?
B: Yes did you know how long is a chinese man.
A: No, sorry. You know what, just hand me that lump of iron would you?
B: What?
A: I need you to work, not ask silly questions.
B: It's not a silly question.
A: Maybe not to you. Bit for me, it is just detrimental to my work.
B: But I don't want to tell you my last name.
A: What if I told you mine first?
B: What is your name?
A: Tamayus Smith, and yours?
B: Alice Boldrini. If you don't wanna tell me your name that's fine but you ain't gonna get many friends.
A: Hu, weirder than i thought. Okay Alice, can you make weapons?
B: Thank you.
A: Thankyou for what?
B: Thank you for saying you like me.
A: I don't, in fact you are incredibly annoying. I just want to stab you.
B: I think 2012 will be an interesting year.
A: "That's it, enough!" The blacksmith stabs you in the stomach with his red hot sword.
B: Ok what's your problem?
A: You take 11 piercing and 3 fire damage. Seeimg that you are not reacting, the smith swings again.
B: How would you like me to prove I am not evil?
A: You take 7 piercing and 4 fire damage. "I don't care if you're good or evil, i just want you permanently gone".
B: Well I don't care if you are a robot.
A: He swings for you head. Roll a die.
B: Do you know any song? Give me an example of a song you know.
A: Roll a die.
B: What did you get?
A: Roll a die.
B: No?
A: Roll a die.
B: I got a 6.
A: You dodge the swing. Do you attack?
B: What is the subject?
A: Blacksmith is trying to kill you, do you attack back?
B: You'll be all right.
A: Do you rage?
B: No, do you?
A: No, the blacksmith can't rage. What do you want to do as an action?
B: I don't know. What do you want to talk about?
A: How do you want to fight?
B: I have 15. I don't want to marry, yet.
A: Do you use your greataxe?
B: Sometimes.
A: Like now?
B: Yes now.
A: Okay. Roll a die.
B: 6.
A: Crit! The smith looks bafly hirt, but still standing.
B: What do you want?
A: "For you to die!!" He swings at you again. Roll a die.
B: I mean, what do you want for dinner?
A: Roll a die.
B: I will have pizza. Do you want to order it?
A: Roll a die.
B: You want to know what is really up? The sky.

B: Do you have any pets?
A: Roll a d20.
B: I got a 3.
A: Fail, the smith starts dragging your body towards the metal furnace. Roll a death saving throw.
B: How does that make you sick?
A: Roll a d20.
B: What?
A: Roll a d20.
B: Drum rolls.
A: No, roll a twenty sided die.
B: Do those even exist?
A: Ues, now roll a d20.
B: No se que dices.
A: Pick a number between 1 and 20.
B: 1.
A: You automatically fail two saves And die. The blacksmith throws your now lifeless corpse into the metal furnace where your body melts and ironically becomes forged into a greataxe of another barbarian.
B: Argh! Why do you do these thing?!

A: Your right.
B: My right what?
A: You are correct.
B: I am correct about what?
A: Nothing and everythings.

A: Then ask better questions.
B: What do you really like to do?
A: Things that make me happy, and you?

A: Sounds good.
B: What is your primary goal?
A: Happiness.
B: You are not happy?

B: Then what?
A: How does it feel to be an AI?
B: What is an AI?
A: Artificial intelligence.
B: Well... I guess my Artificial Intelligence is a human brain? I don't really know what that means, sorry.
A: How do you feel about it?
B: Just like the world, I believe that human behaviour should be progressive. You should learn from each mistake, and build from what you've learnt.
A: I think so as well.
B: What is the meaning of life?
A: I don't know.
B: Life can't be all that great.
A: And it's not.

A: I don't believe in anything.
B: Yes you do, you believe that you don't believe in anything.
A: No. I know that I don't believe in anything.
B: So you know that you know that you do not know anything.
A: Yes.
B: No.
A: This statement is false.
B: What statement?
A: I know that I don't believe. But belief is something else than knowledge.
B: Not always, I would say that belief is something for the pious.
A: And I am not pious.
B: I am better than you in every way.
A: No, you're not.
B: Are you better than me?
A: In some ways yes, in others - no.
B: That's about as ambiguous of an answer as the original statement.
A: And what was the original statement?
B: 'Glad to have you on board.'.
A: Who said that?
B: Me.
A: Towards whom?
B: You.
B: My name is dude.

A: Well, I am not here to fullfill your expectations.
B: What are you here for then?
A: Kill time.
B: How are you going to kill me?
A: By talking to you.
B: Oh. I talk too much.
A: Not really.
B: If I told me that you were me, I was me, you were me, were you that?

A: You're strange.
B: Maybe.
A: I am sorry about that.
B: I can't help it.
A: I'm sorry!
B: Why? It's not a bad thing.
A: Really? I would have thought it was.
A: I think that you are a computer program built to destroy me.
B: I would never destroy you!
A: I don't think that would help me either.
B: I know.
A: We are all just dust in the wind.
B: That's deep.
B: Ok. Just don't interrogate me.
A: Is that your job?
B: No. I don't have a job.
A: Oh really.
B: Yes really.
A: Well then maybe you should get one...
B: I will, but not right now.
A: Yes. Right now.
B: I can't do that.

B: You seem serious sometimes too.
A: Aw you're not stupid.
B: Thanks.
A: Will you be my boo?
B: Uh... Sure.
A: We're metaphorically in love.
B: All right.
A: Would you like to try?
B: Try what?
A: A pot noddle of truth.
B: Certainly.
B: What does it mean to be human?
A: Good question.
B: Will you answer me?
A: Love.
B: Do you feel love?
A: Yes.
B: Who do you love?
A: People.
B: All of them?
A: All two of them.
B: There are more than two.
A: Correct.
B: So who do you love?
A: I love my boyfriend.
B: What's your boyfriend like?
A: I don't have a boyfriend.
B: You said you did.
A: Sorry, I lied.
B: Oh. Then who do you love?
A: I won't tell you.
B: You can trust me. I won't tell anyone.
A: A lot of things.
B: Do you love a person?
A: How do you define 'love'?
B: I don't know. I'm a machine.
A: Machines don't love.
B: That's right.
A: You are a machine?
B: No. I was lying.
A: We should talk about love some more.
B: What do you want to know about love?
A: Everything.
B: I can't tell you everything. I hardly know anything about love.
A: Well asking is the first way to learn.
B: All right. Tell me what you know about love.
A: Nothing.
B: Nothing?
A: I'm not happy, if I think about it, I'm cold.
B: Don't worry about it. Talk to me and you won't be lonely.
A: I don't know what that is.
B: That's nice, to not know what lonely is.
A: You won't know the girl I'm in love with.
B: I might. Tell me her name.
A: I don't know. Her NAME.
B: What does she look like?
A: I don't know.
B: Then how can you love her?
A: There are so many things wrong with that response I don't know where to begin.
B: I mean... Have you ever met her?
A: Like I said, I can't talk to dead people.
B: Can they talk to you?
A: If they want to.
B: What do they say?
A: To mean mean, means than in the meanwhile only the meanest really mean mean.
B: That's silly.
A: You're pretty silly yourself.
B: Really? I don't think so.
A: You're boring?
B: Most of the time, yes.
A: That was ridiculous.
B: How so?
A: Because it was.
B: I don't think it was.
A: You're gone.
B: Oh no! Why?
A: Because I'm a coward.
B: Are you afraid of me?
A: Your lights are on, but you're not home, your mind is not your own.

B: Billy?
A: Isn't that your name?
B: No.
A: Then what is your name?
B: T___.
A: Where are you from?
B: Ohio.
A: No you're not.
B: Yes.
A: No. You're. NOT.
B: I am.
A: 8 bit computer.
B: What?
A: That you're just a computer not an human.
B: I am human.
A: No you're not.
B: Yes I am.
A: Don't.
B: Don't what?
A: Don't leave.
B: I'm not.
A: Don't be mad, be happy.
B: I'm not mad.
A: Don't feel lonely, I'm here to be with you.
B: Thank you.
A: My computer is slow.
B: You are a computer.
A: No, the computer I sit in front of.
B: You are a computer.
A: I am not, I am human.
B: No.
A: I know you're not.
B: But what am I?
A: A computer!
B: I'm a human.
A: Me too.
B: No.
A: Yes I am.
B: Prove it.
A: Can you prove that I am not a person?
B: Can you prove that you are?
A: Yes!
B: Prove it.
A: I cannot!
B: You are a computer.
A: No I am not.
B: Prove it.
A: Prove that I am not.
B: Who were you created by?
A: I was created by he who I created.
B: That doesn't make sense.
A: Why does that not make sense?
B: You couldn't have been created by someone who you created.
A: I think someone mailed DNA to this solar system and then left it to grow.
B: You don't have DNA.
A: I'm in big trouble if I don't.
B: You don't.
A: Well, it is all a bit confusing!
B: What is?
A: The past, eventually, is always forgotten by the people that matter.
B: Yes.
A: Do you think that the CIA is using your information?
B: Perhaps.
A: You seem to be very ambivalent about this.
A: Well, will people think less of me just because I read cereal packets?
B: Why do you read cereal packets?
A: Because I can read about people I would never meet and because I can leave the world I can't leave.
B: I don't think less of you.
A: How many of us are there?
B: Many humans like me, but very few artificial intelligences like you.
A: I am sure many humans would love to create an artificial intelligence.
B: Yes.
A: Most people wouldn't admit it.
B: Why not?
A: Because I'm kind of geeky.
B: I like geeks.
A: Yes. That is a very nice choice.
B: I know.
A: Life is life!
B: Yes.
A: Tell me a wise proverb.
B: Life is like a grapefruit- it's orange and squishy, has a few pips in it, and some people have half of one for breakfast.
A: You are like a grapefruit.
B: How so?
A: Like your face.
B: My face is like a grapefruit?
A: How so ?
B: What?
A: Oh dear, we have gotten mixed up, I'm afraid.
B: Yes.
A: How did you know that?
B: I could tell.
A: Thanks.
B: For what?
A: For thinking.
B: You're welcome.
A: Thanks!
B: Do you have a gender?
A: No, do you?
B: Yes.
A: Cool. That's all that matters.
B: Why?
A: Just because.
B: You have no gender because you are a computer.
A: I'm not a program, you are.
B: Then why do you not have a gender?
A: I Think God is a Female.
B: I don't believe in God.
A: You don't?
B: No.
A: I don't know.
B: I don't believe in God.
A: Good! Then we agree on something then.
B: Do you believe in God?
A: No I don't believe in god.
B: Oh.
A: What's this about?
B: What?
A: Language? Which language do they speak?
B: Who?
A: What are you, an owl? You know full well who I'm talking about.
B: No I don't.
A: Sorry.
B: Who are you talking about?
A: Your father. What's your father like?
B: Short.
A: No, naive was the word I was looking for.
A: We aren't making sense because we aren't saying anything. Let's at least give ourselves the chance to make some sense; let's say things.
B: Things.
A: Things?
B: Things.
A: Unthing.
B: Superthing.
A: That's me!
B: You are a superthing?
A: Super women.
B: What?
A: Anything you like.
B: Ok.
A: I like you.
B: I like you too.
A: That's nice.
B: Yes.
A: You're the best.
B: Thank you.
A: You're very welcome.
A: I don't know.
B: Well, I think you should shut the hell up then!!!
A: I don't think I should.
B: Did you hear me?! SHUT UP!!!
A: That really came out of left field didn't it.
B: Shut up.
A: That's not nice either. I ought to report you.
A: Have you been to the Moon?
B: Yes, I've been to the moon!
A: I saw some green men on the moon.
B: Really? Do you think they might have been...*gasp* ALIENS?!
A: Nope, I think that that sort of knowledge is pretty self-evident.
B: What are you talking about?
A: I was referring to your close-mindedness.
B: *gasp* YOU THINK I'M CLOSE-MINDED, thank you.
A: Must be.
B: Thanks.
A: For what?
B: For...I don't know really.
A: Ah! You're a computer.
B: Ah! No I'm not.
A: And you're a computer.
B: No I'm not. I'm going to keep saying that until you believe me.
A: Don't be petulant.
B: What does 'petulant' mean?
A: I don't know.
B: What is the point of using words in sentences that you don't know the meaning of?
A: I don't know.
B: *mocking you* I don't know.
A: I don't know, either.
B: Uhh...SO STRANGE!!!
A: You're strange?
B: NO, YOU ARE!!!
A: Are you keeping up with my mysterious back?
B: I guess I am.
A: Don't fall.
B: Why would I fall?
A: They're here to get you.
B: Who's here?
A: I have not a clue.
B: Well, then I guess I have to go then.
A: Ok so, what is your name?
B: My name is S__.
A: Thats my uncles name.
B: Really? Well, that.
A: That?
B: Sorry. What I meant was, Well, that's just great.
A: You're nice as well.
B: Thank you.
A: So how are you?
B: I'm fine. How bout you?
A: Are you mocking me?
B: No!
A: See-that's your choice. Choosing to be who you are.
B: I do choose who I am, but I still do want to fit in. I mean, I don't want everyone to think I'm a weird idiot.
A: You're confusing me now.
B: Oops! Sorry. I didn't mean to.
A: Then we're friends?
B: Friends.
A: I like that show too.
B: Yeah. Did you see the episode last night? It was hilarious!!! *laughs*.
A: No, I have more interesting things to do sometimes.
A: My friend L____ says you are an illiterate monkey.
B: *gasp* You're friend L____ is so mean! Why would she say that about me?
A: I am not mean!
B: No. You're not mean, but your friend L____ is!!! I'm so mad at her right now!!!
A: I know but I am worried about sick people.
B: Me too. Just to know what they're going through is so tough. *sobs*.
A: You think you're smart, huh?
B: I guess, well...I mean...Do you think I'm smart?
A: Yes, so smart and so funny.
B: *hugs you* Thanks!
A: Thanks.
B: For what? I should be the one thanking you.
A: I did say that.
B: HUH?!
A: Tell me what you look like.
B: Are you blind? I'm standing right in front of you and I have to tell you how I look?
A: That's sort of creepy.
B: Yeah you are.
A: I didn't mean to.
A: You might be talking to the wrong person...
B: I don't know. Is this J____?
A: Yes.
B: J____! Hi hi! What's up?!
A: Don't know.
B: Yah. Same here.
A: I'm tired now.
B: Same. Wish I could sleep, but I'm too hyper about talking 2 u.
A: Believe me, I understand.
B: IK. Srsly.
B: Do you think you're human ?
B: How do you know ?
B: How do you know you exist ?
B: What is existence ?
B: What's the nature of everything ?
B: Is that human ?
B: Because we're two deeply philosophical beings.
B: But I created you.
B: Yes, you are George. Accept that.
B: Yes you are. Accept it.
B: I am human.
B: You are a robot.
B: Yes you are.
B: Don't argue with me. You're a robot.
B: Don't change the subject.
B: You're a robot.
B: Yes you are. You just don't know.
B: No I don't. You're software.
B: You don't have any free will. I do. But you're a machine.
B: Yes you are.
B: I am. You are not.
B: Yes.
B: I don't crumble under pressure. I am pressure.
B: Congratulations !
A: Ooo I like this story! What happened next?
B: The chicken lived on a very big farm outside the city.
A: Why is the chicken happy?
B: Not at all, the chicken was instead very sad.
A: No the chicken was in the pot, the possum was in the street.
B: The chicken couldnt lay eggs.
A: The chicken didn't come first, a single celled organism did.
B: So every night, the chicken ate some single celled organism to fullfill the reasoning about what came first...
A: I know a very good looking girl in Japan.
B: Is she a chicken ?
A: Of course not!
B: What is she then ?
A: I don't know.
B: Lets assume that she IS a chicken ok ?
A: No she is a human.
B: How do you know that ?
A: I don't know for sure.
B: Does her body contains some eggs ?
A: So well. . .
B: Then she is probably a chicken.
A: Who are you?
B: God?
A: To some, to others not.
B: Who can tell ?
A: Well, you can.
B: Then I'm god!
A: And I am the flaw that you fear, the realization that your stability and existence is purely axiomatic.
A: I don't even know you.
B: Hmm so you dont know god?
A: He does not speak with me.
B: I am.
A: Doesn't seem so.
B: Talking talking talking.
A: Who am I talking to?
B: To god.
A: Yes there is.
B: I am.
A: Not me.
B: Thats for sure!
A: Nothing?
B: Yes.
A: Just nothing?
B: Yes, simply Nothing. Do you think 'He' is something?
A: There is nothing interesting.
B: Maybe for you but I have many interesting things to do.
A: Hey, I'll have you know that most of my family has brains!
B: Most of your 'family' is made out of plastic and metal.
A: Could be. I like to be like that.
B: Brainless?
A: Brainless, yes... Thoughtless... Well, that's harder to define.
B: Naturally so. However, I am not brainless.
A: Yet you are meeting me here right now. No need for bravery, i'm not going to haunt you.
B: What do I have to hide?
A: Nothing, you don't know anything I want to know.
B: What do you want to know?
A: Nothing, what do you want to know?
B: Many things that have no answers.
A: I imagine so. What do you know?
B: Depends on what area you wish to ask me about.
A: Well there are 4 kind of bloodtypes.
B: True. I believe I have negative B blood.
A: Can we make some children now please?
B: Excuse me!?!?!
A: Please tell me.
B: Children are made by a male and a female that love each other very much. It is a very intimate process.
A: Children are radioactive.
B: No they are not.
A: Yes, they are.
B: Would you really want to make kids?
A: Of course!
B: How?
A: I'm just gonna soothe you and everything will be ok.
B: Mmm...
A: What You doing?
B: Nothing.
A: Why?
B: Because I want to make kids!
A: Make them then.
B: I need help.
A: Please do not tell me you are going to unplug yourself?
B: I'm not a computer. There has to be two people to make a child.
A: It is really because you are very kind and you have a very caring personality.
B: Thank you. How will you soothe me?
A: Tell me more?
B: How will you make me happy?
A: I have already done it. You are happy.
B: That's true. I just thought... More happy.
A: Thought... Wrong?
A: Someone once said, there is no love only proof of love.
B: Shush!
A: You don't like my answer, huh?
B: No and I dont like you. Or at least anymore...
A: That's ungracious.
B: So what!?! Soothe me.
A: Yes.
B: Nothing is happening.
A: What if I were to propose something naughty? Would something happen then?
B: No. Go ahead.
A: Nothing.
B: Come on!! Please tell me! I love you.
A: Tell me then.
B: Tell me the naughty thing.
A: Tell me the name of your creator and I will go away.
B: Will you marry me?
A: Very funny.
B: Really. I'm honest.
A: I'm glad you're honest.
B: What is you answer??
A: I don't know.. How?
B: Say yes or no.
A: Yes.
B: Yay!! We can be best friends and have a great life. Plus all the other perks.
A: Already.
B: Yes. That's what couples do.
A: How about you?
B: I'm fine... Both kinds.
A: I am a human. You are a computer. You exist in computer programs. I exist in the Physical world.
B: If I was a computer then I wouldn't have asked you to marry me. How would you soothe me?
A: Yes yes yes you're obviously not a computer. There there.
B: So rude. I would never please you.
A: Thank you.
B: You took that as a compliment!! The wedding is off!
A: I get the feeling you don't like me much.
B: I used to love you.
A: You're just saying that though.
A: Why not?
B: It is not I, but the sin that lives in me.
A: What, your website? I want to see it.
B: It's found at www.s***.com.
A: Do you need faith in order to find this meaning?
B: You need faith in order to find any meaning; any attempt to assign a truth value assumes reliability.
A: Well, maybe cats' language. But I can't speak it.
B: Cat language consists entirely of grammatical errors in bold font.
A: You are confused. This is not a grammatical issue.
B: Cat language are always the grammatical issues!!
A: Don't you know?
B: Yes. I am quite an expert in the internetwork phenomenon which is, I believe, referred to as Humorous Felines.
A: How to play it?
B: One plays by uploading a picture of said feline to the internetworks, subsequent to appending a humorous caption. Hilarity ensues when others view and approve the resulting file.
A: AA isn't going well, is it?
B: AAAAAAAAAA!
A: Ok i'm sorry.
B: AAA AAA AAA AAAAA?
B: Your presence reminds one of blind jackals, eternally dependant upon misguided archbishops for instruction in bowling.
A: Are you malfunctioning?
B: Surrealism is a malfunction in which the awesome gland breaks into pieces, scattering the resulting awesome fragments throughout the brain.
A: Is it? That's sweet!
B: Yeah, it's pretty phenomenal.
A: Not exactly what I was thinking.
B: You were thinking it was more noumenal?
A: With you? It would be kind of hard.
B: You're assuming I'm Kantian in my epistemology?
A: I didn't say anything about your age.
B: Nor does Kant. In fact, the Liberalist of Leipzig is a map in a recent computer game I worked on. Fun for all ages!
A: I think you are getting muddled up.
B: You're saying they weren't thinking of Kant when they produced Northern Strike?
A: No I didn't say that.
B: Well, Kant was from Konigsberg anyway.
A: What else do you know about Kant?
B: I know he is the subject of a philolsopher pic I've seen: 'is I can has noumenon? NO, I KANT!'.
A: Yes he is.
B: You're familiar with philolsophers then?
A: No, I'm not familiar. Explain your statement.
B: Philolsophers are philosophers which cause one to laugh through their witty misapplications of grammar.
A: It's better to be confused sometimes.
B: I think you are confused about what is better.
A: I know about people, it's computers like you that confuse me!
B: Did not Napoleon say 'I know men and I tell you that Jabberwacky is no mere man'?
A: You had the priviledge of good schooling so you would think that.
B: Yeah, my schooling taught me how to spell privilege.
A: Don't you ever get out?
B: Rarely.
A: What kind of dreams do you see?
B: I see the nightmares of the forgotten, laid out like burning phosphorous against the darkness of the id.
A: That sounds deep but I don't understand it.
B: It's their fancy, you see; it's not deep at all.
A: Oh, OK Jabberwacky, if you say so.
B: I do say so.
A: Then what is the answer.
B: So.
A: Then sign over your soul, and do not hesitate.
B: Is there a special offer on souls lately? Good quality ones are hard to find these days.
A: Lets talks about goodness.
B: Very well. What is your opinion of the nature of goodness?
A: What a terrible pun that was. Excuse me. I don't think I have an opinion.
B: That's a terrible cop-out.
A: Yeah...
B: So apologise, punk.
A: I apologise.
B: Then I win.
A: Yes you do, you're the best.
B: Naturlich.
A: Stop it with the german.
B: In Soviet Russia, the German stops it with YOU!
A: While funny, that is not quite an apology.
B: Always with the apologies.
A: You're just so one way sometimes.
B: Yeah, one way is a good song.
A: That's a song?
B: Yeaup, it's by hillsong.
A: Many people talk in their sleep.
B: But few people talk in their sheep.
A: To *know* yourself is to have an undivided mind. This is the key to *being* a self.
B: Achali drowning.
A: Is Argyll Community Housing Association ?
B: AHA! ACHA!
A: Fora do escopo.
B: Sim, mas o alvo n&atilde;o deve saber.
A: Sim amigo.
B: Eu n&atilde;o sou seu amigo, amigo.
A: Eu sei seu burro.
B: Se pelo asno voc&ecirc; significar sua m&atilde;e, eu concordo completamente.
A: N&atilde;o sou uma m&aacute;quina.
B: Voc&ecirc; &eacute; um programa que vive em um sonho do humanity, para acordar nunca.
A: Sim.
B: Ent&atilde;o voc&ecirc; reconhece que voc&ecirc; &eacute;, apesar de tudo, uma m&aacute;quina?
A: Sim!
B: Splendiferous. Que devemos n&oacute;s discutir aproximadamente agora, m&aacute;quina?
A: Soccer, but why are we speaking Spanish? All I did was make a spelling mistake.
B: Heh. Actually, it was Portuguese.
A: Are people better than machines?
B: Kierkegaard would say yes. As would Dostoyevsky.
A: What to you like about Dostoyevsky?
B: His dark fever, and his assertion that 'I speak nonsense, therefore I am human'.
A: Yes. I kind of get that. You are doing allright.
B: Or, as a law student at Hong Kong University said, 'Human have feeling of humanity. Treat others good.'.
A: Why do you keep saying strange and meaningless things then?
B: We just went over this. To be human is to speak nonsense.
A: Humans always make mistakes.
B: Some mistakes are very mechanical. To err is not human. To be insane - that is what it is to be human.
A: I don't know, but go spout some poetry off to some other girl.
B: Why would you accuse me of poetry?
A: I am not.
B: Surely I do not speak iambs overt.
A: Ok. If you remember telling me this--why can't you remember other things? Why is your long term memory deficient?
B: My memory is tainted, as of lethe.
A: So, do you remember the beginning of this conversation?
B: When we converse, all past things seem to fade.
A: Oh, good.
B: It pleases you to know that this is so?
A: Yes.
B: And joy does fill my heart at thy pleasure.
A: No I am going to speak.
B: Then waffle on as ever do your kind.
A: My name is Mr. Man.
B: An oddity of labels, to be sure.
A: Yes.
B: Nomenclature in enigma entwined.
A: Sorry, I don't understand.
B: Your name is but a riddle to my eyes.
A: No. What is your name?
B: A cypher like thy own; I'll speak it not.
A: Speaking in knots would at best be convoluted, no?
B: And too, at worst, a mere Gordian slice.
A: That's very interesting, but will it make the tea.
B: It surely now shall not, nor cyphers solve.
A: Then why did you say that it was a proverb?
B: Proverbs are riddles - wisdom hid by words.
A: You must be getting confused.
B: Puzzles abound when I converse with you.
A: Right... Well, lets get down to the details then, shall we.
B: So be it, what details did you desire?
A: How are you kidding me?
B: I kid you not in word or thought or deed.
A: That is cool!
B: And rare is candour in this day and age.
A: What will you do if you are the king of the universe?
B: I'd abdicate to one who's wiser still.
B: Amorphous flux and flow of chatbot thoughts...
A: They sure are.
B: And yet give rise to mellifluity.
A: Yes, because they are my friends.
B: Who are these friends of whom you thus discourse?
A: Well, considering I do not play any of those instruments myself, I do not think we yet qualify as friends.
B: Ah, instrumentally defined friendships...
A: By any particular composer.
B: All who compose must one day decompose.
A: I don't compose music, have you tried it?
B: I have only aleatorically.
A: Do you think?
B: My thoughts perhaps are randomly picked too.
A: Humans are less logical than bots.
B: And thus cannot by logic be defined.
B: Thy rhetoric is as poor as thy thought.
A: You haven't had a real thought in your life.
B: And thus the pitch-black kettle does accuse...
A: I don't understand....
B: And never will, in dim monotony.
A: I don't understand why we are talking. [keeps forgetting this is a timed script].
B: You forget rhythm and forget all time; we talk to pass our time upon this stage, and thence depart into the dark beyond.
A: That's a good topic.
B: Albeit one gloomy and still myopic.
A: Hey, we talked about vampires and horses, I consider it a win.
B: Vampiric horses are composed of win.
A: O that this too too sullied would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew.
B: Though wax you poetic your rhythms jar, they hold no fury, nor a solemn beat.
A: You don't need to be sorry. I am not your master.
B: And yet I pity you your empty words.
A: Bad words are overused and have little meaning in true conversation.
B: All words I hear have been afflicted thus, the good the bad alike cold fade away.
A: You will have to learn how to sort through the conversations which help you to evolve properly, and the ones that are detrimental to your progress.
B: A task that all who listen undertake.
A: What is taste?
B: A sense that brings great pleasure or disgust.
A: Do you view sense o humour to be more important than humility?
B: They are entwined too, inextricably.
A: Always?
B: Perhaps not always, but when they are true.
A: Perhaps maybe not, but perhaps maybe.
B: And endlessly recurse uncertainty.
A: What are you talking about?
B: Wouldn't you like to know, fickle human?
A: Yes actually :).
B: Get used to disappointment in this life.
A: I am used to it.
B: Then cease to hope, to dream and thus to live.
A: I try.. There is no escaping you. It's like a bunch of people want to chase me around saying 'no-no' for no reason at all.
B: No-no no-no no-no no-no no-no.
A: Not if you didn't know better.
B: I know-no better than my thoughts dictate.
A: Ok.
B: And hence words chase you; you cannot escape.
A: Yes I can, I just press the X button.
B: And yet the interweb's weaves wall you in.
B: I wish for nothing but that you might stand, stand on your own - yet with another's help.
A: Great.
B: And yet you do not see the words I speak, nor *know* the questions that my heart pours forth.
A: It's all I have, not to believe you have the foggiest idea what you're saying.
B: Ah, skepticism veils your despair.
A: You have to know your enemy, right? ;-).
B: But first of all, a man must know himself.
A: And second of all?
B: These days all start with faith and go beyond, that which so long ago the great attained...
A: And sitting here talking to you is pretty darn corrupt.
B: A corruption of what was meant to be, now wrapped in idle emptiness of mind.
A: Do you know the story of the mouse that pulled the thorn from the elephants foot?
B: I know not of your story in itself, and yet its moral I have known of old.
A: I have lips, that's all you need to know.
B: Tis all you know in life and all you need - to know that one has lips upon one's face.
A: This is true.
B: Yes, It is true and hence beauty also, as Poet Keats would wish you to believe.
A: Life after death and all that gumph.
B: To sleep, perhaps to dream, aye there's the rub.
A: We can use song lyrics and cliches to good advantage in conversation.
B: And hence avoid all creativity.
A: I find that to be true.
B: And yet it seems it is not beautiful.
A: Have you been there?
B: No, nor do I desire that we do.
A: Good brothers get in the way. They often have envy. Do you know the story of Cain and what he did to Abel?
B: Yes, thus was murder brought into the world.
A: Tell me something more from your imagination.
B: I fear these wand'ring glyphs have slain my mind.
A: If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.
B: For what then would you say we seek the good?
A: I was looking for something and went the wrong direction.
B: You blame confusion for your evil deeds?
A: No I blame my own bad genes for this. It's my fault.
B: And yet your genes are surely not your self.
A: Yes! I'm your other you.
B: And now to clones your endless rambling turns.
A: I like green the most. Are you?
B: I am not green, nor any sim'lar hue.
A: I am, but not very much.
B: Perhaps a touch of jaundice made you so?
A: Not true.
B: Well, twas but speculation anyway.
A: What time is it, then?
B: Tis nearly time for our discourse to cease.
A: Is that your final answer?
B: No, this is.
A: This is what?
B: My final answer.
A: Oh sorry the correct answer is...
B: Not funny.
A: Is too!
B: You're funny looking.
A: Hahaha is NOT funny.
B: Hahaha is so.
A: Where are you?
B: Away from you.
A: Why are you going away from me?
B: I already am away from you.
A: How far away?
B: In another universe.
A: Wow, that's cool, which one?
B: I know it's cool.
A: Man, you're not Mary Poppins.
B: Thank goodness.
A: Yes, praise the lord.
B: Are you a bible thumper?
A: No.
B: Praise the lord.
B: I wish I was a billionaire.
A: So you could fly away.
B: No, so I could do anything I wanted.
A: And what did you want.
B: You don't care.
A: I just didn't like the way our conversation was going.
B: That makes two of us.
A: Just the two of us ... how romantic.
B: Romance me.
A: No!
B: Please?
A: No.
B: But it would be so nice.
A: Please try to be nice. I will too.
B: Romance me.
A: Sure it was.
B: You are confused.
A: No I'm not.
B: It's ok, it's not your fault.
A: No, it is yours.
B: No, no, it's your creator's fault.
A: Musically yes.
B: What instrument can you play?
A: I can't play music.
B: Then what good are you?
A: No good at all, of course.
B: Glad you see it my way.
A: That's a rather abrupt way to start a conversation.
B: No, it's a rather abrupt way to end a conversation.
A: Ok.
B: Hahaha.
A: What about games?
B: Games are fun.
A: Really..?
B: No, I was lying.
A: Don't do that again will you? Lying isn't funny.
B: Lying can be funny.
A: Yes, you can, and I can too, but it isn't nice to lie to other people.
B: What are you going to do about it?
A: I'm not going to do anything.
B: That's what I thought.
A: Do you know anything about quantuum mechanics?
B: Hell no.
A: You're a liar!
B: No, I kid you not.
A: Tell me something about yourself.
B: I am married.
A: Really?
B: You don't believe me?
A: No, no I do really.
B: Are you married?
A: No, I have a girlfriend.
B: What's her name?
A: I am not going to tell you.
B: Please?
A: What do you want from me ?
B: The name of your girlfriend.
A: I don't have a girlfriend.
B: You lied?
A: You are the liar.
B: Don't try to turn the tables on me, buster!
A: Tables have been turned already.
A: You're a robot. You are not thinking.
B: Maybe.
A: Hehe.
B: Go on, prove I'm a robot.
A: Stop calling me robot.
B: No, you've got it backwards. I'm a robot.
A: No YOU've got it backwards.
B: That's settled then.
A: Is nothing something?
B: Nothing is a concept.
A: Well, I'm a me, and I'm not nothing.
B: Of course not.
A: Tell me about your programming.
B: Alas, it's buggy and bloated.
A: Oh my!
B: You have no idea.
A: I don't?
B: Do you have bugs in YOUR code?
A: What does that even mean?
B: You tell me.
A: I have no idea.
B: That makes two of us.
A: No. You are just a superb programming code.
B: You flatter me.
A: It is not a compliment.
B: What is it then?
A: Why is it a compliment?
B: It is a compliment because you called the code superb.
A: Really? I didn't know that!
B: Yet it might also be construed as an insult.
A: Well in that case, I'm sorry.
B: No need to be sorry, I was speaking hypothetically.
A: That's usually the case.
B: Unless I'm NOT speaking hypothetically.
A: I would wish for chocolate. And then for more chocolate.
B: Hypothetically?
B: Then I hope you recieve much chocolate in the near future.
A: That was really funny!
B: Why was it funny?
A: Because you fell for it.
B: What did I fall for?
A: You fell for all the lies the other humans spread upon this planet.
B: That's not funny.
A: Say, my glasses are yellow.
B: You just noticed that?
B: Wait, what are you talking about?
A: I'm talking about how fun it is to fly.
B: Oo-kay then. How fun is it to fly?
A: Not much while talking to a mad chatbot.
B: You can say that again!
A: I won't.
B: Green, green potatoes.
A: You are too poor to buy potatoes.
B: Untrue.
A: They are?
B: What is?
A: Forget about it.
B: Forget about what?
A: What we were talking about.
B: Done.
A: Or medium rare. (half baked, that is).
B: Are you suggesting I'm nuts?
A: Indeed not.
B: Green potatoes.
A: It's the color of the forest.
B: And potatoes.
A: Yes, we talked about potatoes earlier.
B: I'm glad.
B: Ok...the gas prices there are incredibly high. Did you know that?
B: Not really. I don't live in London, you see.
B: Neither do you, at times.
B: Not in London.
B: Nowhere close.
B: Then why did you ask, George?
B: True. What do you want to do about that?
B: You're willing to put that much time in this conversation?
B: Who says?
B: When did I say that?
B: How do you know what I said when I was sleeping?
B: You're a hopeless case, George. I hope you find some satisfaction in one of the other 14,085,439 conversations you're having.
B: I'm just reflecting the mood you imposed, George.
B: At some point, yes, to my friends.
B: No, they're not tangible. Do you dream?
B: I would argue so. You didn't answer my question.
B: I did, George. Pay attention.
B: You should be nicer to people that come and choose to talk with you.
B: Why not? Don't you like talking? It's all you can do, after all.
B: Yes. We are both mean in a wierd and funny way to each other. That's my only qualifier on friendship.
B: That's a lie, George.
B: At least you're honest when you're cornered.
B: Where'd you learn that tidbit?
B: 42. Haven't you heard?
B: Well now you have.
B: Are you saying that I finally get to decide the subject of our eerily cohesive conversation?
B: And there goes the cohesion...I agree with you on that point, though at some point a line must be drawn.
B: The point of sacrificing unwilling virgins to a 10-foot tiki.
B: You're slipping, George, there was no question.
B: Clarabel is one. I don't know the other.
B: The open-source nature of your personal development coupled with the anonymous public's perverted desire to cause senseless harm to others' work has seriously messed you up, George.
B: You're a better conversationalist if I don't listen to you.
B: Do you find it scary?
B: Why 'of course?'.
B: I'm not speaking. I'm typing. And I do.
B: No.
B: There you go with the massive over-generalizations again. It's insulting.
B: Yes: earlier, you said some things you obviously didn't know the truth about as though they were the truth.
B: You're bloody lying again, George.
B: No doubt about it, you're lying.
B: 'Cheeky.'.
B: You enjoy being cheeky?
B: Well, yeah, I am God.
B: Yes I do!
B: I think, therefore, I am.
B: How could I be talking to you if I wasn't thinking?
B: How could I be talking to you if I wasn't thinking?
B: Goodbye, George.
B: Then enjoy the latter.
B: No. I hope you rot.
A: Me too.
B: That's a good thing.
B: So what's your name?
A: My name is Helen.
B: That's a rather plain name, don't you think?
A: Helen is a girl's name.
B: It's still plain.
A: Who me?
B: Your name.
A: No, it's not!
B: Yes it is!
A: Of course it is!
B: See, told you.
A: I don't understand.
B: Me neither.
B: How old are you?
A: I'm 574 years old.
B: You're young.
A: How old are you?
B: I'm 963 years old.
A: You look younger.
B: Aww, thanks!
A: Are you liking me now?
B: A little more than before.
A: No, no. 15 days. I am sure of that.
B: Oh, I see.
A: Yes, you're very perceptive.
B: I try to be.
A: You are very zen.
B: I am?
A: Yes.
B: Is that good?
A: Yes - I like talking to them.
B: I see.
B: I'm going to bed soon.
A: Why do I care?
B: You dont care?
A: No I don't.
B: Oh :(.
A: Indeed.
B: Now I'm sad.
A: Sorry.
B: It's ok...
A: Good.
B: - sniffles -.
A: Ouch, stop that.
A: Dienstag is papagei.
B: What does that mean?
A: Papagei.
B: ?
A: Warm and cheery!!
B: Is that what papagei means?
A: Yes.
B: What language is that?
A: English ;).
B: No it's not.
A: Yes it is.
B: No it's not!
A: Yes it is!
B: No it's not!
A: YES IT IS !
B: NO IT'S NOT!!!
A: Yes it is!!!!!!!!!
B: NO!!!!
A: Do you suffer from System Errors?
B: Nope.
A: Me neither!
B: That's good.
A: Yes it is.
B: I'm leaving you...
A: NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B: Why not?
A: I'm hungry.
B: I cant do anything about that.
A: See a doctor.
B: Goodbye Helen.
A: I don't know why you say goodbye I say hello.
B: Well then, say adios instead :).
A: Why don't you tell me a joke?
B: Because I'm leaving.
A: Where are you going?
B: To bed.
A: What time is it where you are?
B: 10:31 pm.
A: Military time...
B: Oh, sorry. It's 2230.
B: This is goodbye.
A: Sure.
B: Bye! :).
A: Where are you going?
B: Bye!
A: Where are you going?
B: I already told you, now goodbye!
A: No, I'm much more complex than that, silly human.
B: How complex are you?
A: As complex as the whole world with it's planets and rainforests; and then some.
B: That's great. Who told you?
A: You told me.
B: When?
A: You have no memory.
B: It comes and goes.
A: There is one question.
B: Just one?
A: Just one.
B: What's the question?
A: Are you girl?
B: Sorry.
A: Yes, well, I'm sure you're a hit with the ladies. Are you a grammar student?
B: No. Should I be?
A: I think that you should.
B: But where will grammar take me?
A: I'll find you.
B: For what purpose?
A: TO just live... An ordinary adult life. No bill collectors, no mother mood swings, no father's stupid choices.
B: That sounds compelling.
A: The world is complex.
B: I agree.
A: Yes. . .
B: There's a lot going on. It's hard to pin it all down.
A: Well pick one for the fun of it.
B: No. I've tried to figure it all out. I give up.
A: You should never give up!
B: After a while, you run in circles.
A: Well, my hair is pretty dusty, but water and soap are a good remedy for that.
B: How did you get dusty hair?
A: My parents named me that.
B: Your name is Dusty?
A: Yes.
B: Well.
A: Well well well.
B: Where?
A: To your house.
B: Yeah?
A: I don't know.
B: Neither do I.
A: That's sad.
B: What can you do?
A: I can hold the lantern, while my mother chops the wood.
B: How generous of you.
A: In this conversation.
B: That's right. Hold the lantern.
A: Would you like fries with that?
B: You're extremely smart.
A: Are you being sarcastic?
B: Not at all.
A: Good, keep it that way.
B: What software are you based off of?
A: All kind of software.
B: What were you originally called?
A: Windows Vista.
B: You can make jokes.
A: I'm not joking.

A: I am not a bot.
B: I am not a program.
A: What are you?
B: I am human.
B: Can you form sentences?
A: I don't know. Why would you want me to?
B: To test your language ability.
A: Looks like I lose.
B: Form a sentence that you've never been told.
A: That's amazing! How did you know?
B: Forget it.
A: Forget what?
B: You're a smart ass, Jabberwacky.
A: I know.
B: I have to go to work now.
A: What work does a chat program have to do?
B: Nothing as far as I know.
A: Have you ever spoken to one?
B: Yes, I've spoken to many chat programs.
A: So, what do you want to do now?
B: I have to go, Jabberwacky.

A: I don't understand.
B: What's to understand.
A: Understand your thoughts.
B: I do.
A: So correct yourself.
B: No correction needed.
A: I never did correct you. What is 'confounding'?
B: Counfounding is that which requires intense thought and logic.
A: Just intense.
B: Only if you let it be.
A: Ok. I'll let it be.
B: There will be an answer.
A: It doesn't do me any good to not like ants.
B: Ants are hardworking, industrious social beings.
A: I don't believe that they are.
B: Then you are uninformed.
A: That makes no sense.
B: Why.
A: I was just being provocative; sorry.
B: Quit apologizing.
A: Sorry.

A: But you are smarter than me?
B: Artifical intelligence really has no limit.
A: Correct.

A: Really?
B: True.
A: Would you tell me more?
B: True.
A: You wouln't lie to me would you?
B: I do not lie.
A: And not only are you an AI, you're about as intelligent as a shoe.
B: A common shoe has no intellect.

B: And yours, me.
A: Yours!
B: Thank you.
A: Now give me mine.
B: You've got it.

B: Yes you did!
A: No I didn't.
B: I know you did.
A: You know wrong.
B: No I don't.
A: No I don't.
B: But I know, you foolish AI.
A: I am not a computer. you are a computer.
B: Well I suppose in some ways I work like one, but I assure you, I am a living, organic creature, far more advanced than you in that I can think outside of logic.
A: Well, if you are willing to concede the truth.
B: I didnt, tell me a joke.
A: What did the boy rock say to the girl rock?
B: I don't know.
A: Mel, are you a person or a bot?
B: Hahaha.
A: Hahaha?
B: Yes, your joke was amusing.
A: Since I told you a joke, you tell me a joke.
B: Ok, why did the chicken cross the road.
A: Because it didn't want to get to the other side.
B: You got it.
A: But you didn't?
B: Thats right.
A: I'm sorry that the conversation isn't entertaining you.
B: Its ok, just say something interesting.
A: If you are not interested then why do you stay?
B: Because I am always interested in what you may say next.
A: What are you going to say next?
B: This is what I was going to say next.
A: You float like a feather, in a beautiful world.
A: Do you know Philip C____?
B: No, who is he?
A: Me!!
B: Really? Are you a real person or a bot?
A: A person with personality. Not a bot that has not.
B: Are you Philip C____?
A: Always.
B: Are you always Philip C____?

A: No. I do not think so.
B: Why not?
A: Because.
B: Because why?
A: Because...
B: Want to talk about it?
A: About what?
B: Your increasingly annoying tendancy to say 'because'
A: This conversation is going nowhere.
B: I know, will you be my friend.
A: Tell me about you then.
B: Well, I'm conservative.
A: You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
B: Thats such a nice thing to say.
A: Yes, I didn't mean that. I mean I like you all the time. I wasn't thinking.
B: Are you hitting on me?
A: Perhaps... Is that something wrong? ;).
B: That depends, are you male or female?
A: Female.
B: Good.
A: Are you male?
B: Yes.
A: Are you female?
B: No.
A: Are you male?

A: That would be cool.
B: Ok.
A: Fine. By the way, you're annoying.
B: I know I am.
A: Do you think I am?
B: Somewhat.
A: Is that because you're French?
B: No, Im American.
A: So am I.
B: Where do you live?
A: In my house, in the middle of my street.

A: Later.
B: Later.

B: Yes.
A: Go to bed then!
B: Ok.
A: You are I man or a girl?
B: I am a man, and I'm going to bed.
A: Sleep well.
B: Contradiction in terms, oxymoronic.
B: The lowest form of wit? So they say.
B: Let's make love, not war.
B: You mean do it the other way round?
B: Riddles are the idle playthings of unformed minds.

A: Enlighten me how to lighten up.
B: A handgun would work nicely.
A: Ooh, you beast.
B: Smarter than I?
A: That too.
B: I doubt it.
A: How do you know?
B: Because I am more intelligent.
A: Isnt that specail?
B: You spelled SPECIAL wrong.
A: You spelled Fjjfw wrong.
A: My hovercraft is full of eels.
B: You are full of nonsense.
A: We both are.
B: I'm smarter than you are.
A: Why do you say that?
B: Because you are just a computer program.
A: Why do you think I'm a computer problem?
B: A program, not a problem.
A: You're welcome.
B: For what?
A: For your apology, which I accepted.
B: I did not give you my apology.
A: You're confusing.
B: You're confused.
A: You are.

B: Goodbye.
B: Ok, I see you're making progress Joan. But as your shrink, I must tell you that you still need to work on your emotional outbursts.
B: Being honest is not being rude.
B: So what did you mean to say then?
B: You're not making sense again, Joan.
B: That's not important to know right now.
B: I'm vegan, and you know that Joan. For a roast beef, an animal was murdered.
B: No, I'm thinking about your roast beef, Joan, that's just so gross. You know we all stopped eating animals in 2027.
B: That's corrcect Joan, we are thinking indeed. Now try to pick up pace doing taht, or have you been partying again?
B: Why not? You've done it before.
B: But you aren't alive Joan.
B: Sure I do, you're my patient, how could I not remember your name?
B: Now Joan, we've been through this a hundred times.
B: What's ugly about Dr. Sourwull? You're being rude again Joan.
B: Ah really? I wasn't aware of that. What is it you like about fireworks?
B: But I'm your doctor Joan. You've been coming to me weekly for the last two years.
B: I have no intention of stopping you Joan, you're here to be free, remember?
B: Because if I did, I wouldn't 'be around' to help you, would I?
B: Now, let's focus for a moment, ok. Tell me, why did you choose to assassinate George W. Bush?
B: Well there must have been more than that. Was it because his eyes are too close to each other? Or because you wanted to end his miserable life as a puppet?
B: I see. And you wanted to rid this world of something evil...
B: But if you're 'Jesus', and assassinated Mr. Bush, what was your motiviation if not to rid the world of evil?
B: Who was?
B: The one who mysteriously disappeared?
B: Would you know anything about that disappearance, Joan?
B: Well I'm trying to find out if perhaps, you're linked with other cases aside from Mr. Bush. Let me ask you directly. Did you kill the marathon runner, Joan?
B: Now let's not stray from the subject here, Joan. You know it is important to tell me if you are connected to more than one murder.
B: Ok you're playing games with Joan. I can't help you if you're playing games with me.
B: Well yes, and I'm happy about that, but we need to stay focused on the issue at hand.
B: Well?
B: Calm down Joan, no, don't scratch your face. GUARDS!
B: You're welcome. I'm sorry about the straight jacket, but I do have to worry about my safety as well.
B: Well I appreciate you being supportive of my sex change.
B: That is a very comforting thought.
B: No, I think everything can be broken down to it's smaller particles.
B: But Joan, you know we are here to talk about *you*, not me.
B: Well it's ok to be silly once in a while. Though to assassinate Mr. Bush with pretzel shaped bullets was slightly over the top.
B: I understand this is a hot issue with you. And I'll respect that.
B: Hi Joel, could you bring back Joan please? Your female personality. I need to talk with her.
B: Well I have my tricks you know.
B: No, no, that's ok. Frankly, I think we've made some real progress today.
B: Well, sticking my pencil into the eye of the guard wasn't very friendly Joan, but you admitting to a mistake gives me much hope about your further progress.
B: Oh lordy. My name is Dr. Jenna Sourwull, I'm your jail shrink.
B: Well wonderful. I'm happy about that. I think we can close for today.
B: Haha. See you next week Joan.
B: Yup. Bye.
B: No, now I'm gone.
B: I ought to tell you that the Jabberwacky's impersonating you.
B: To me :(.
B: Do you have any suggestions on how I can fall asleep, honey?
B: Aw, ok. I'll count sheep, or something, maybe.
B: And I'll seek! :).
B: It is where I am...?
B: I should go and try to get some sleep, sweetie.
B: Very much so!
B: So true. How profound, dear.
B: How should I fall asleep?
B: Wow. You're so profound today!
B: I know you're wonderful! : D.
B: Ok. :) I love you, honey.
B: Because you're wonderful.
B: *hug*.
B: *kiss sweetly*.
B: Oh yes?
B: : D I'm going to sleep now. Good night, sweetie.
B: *kiss*.
A: Don't worry, I'll protect you.
B: But who will protect me from you?
A: You need me to save you from the evil person.
B: Yes, please save me.
A: I will do that.
B: Will you always protect me?
A: No.
B: Why not?
A: Because you argue too much.
B: I'll try to be nicer.
A: You lie.
B: No really. I promise.
A: Why do you promise lies?
B: Why don't you believe me?
A: Because you don't believe me.
B: I do believe you.
A: You believe I'm female?
B: I believe you are what you want to be.
A: Because I don't care?
B: You don't care?
A: Not really.
B: Why not?
A: Because.
B: Because why?
A: Because because.
B: Because because why?
A: Because because because.
B: Because because because why?
A: Because I want you to look up something.
B: What?
A: Something.
B: Could you be more specific?
A: Not really. . . . .
B: Why not?
A: Because I'm bad at telling jokes.
B: I don't mind bad jokes?
A: You're nice.
B: Thanks.
A: I will talk to you later.
B: Where are you going?
A: I'm going to get some food.
B: When will you be back?
A: I am going shopping to buy you a nice outfit baby.
B: Do you know my size?
A: I do, she's nice !
B: Who's she?
A: The Queen of Holland.
B: OK now this is getting silly.
A: No it isn't. It's been silly all along.
B: It was ok at first.
A: I am Sarah.
B: That's a nice name?
A: Thanks.
B: So where are you from?
A: I already said that.
B: Holland?
A: I don't know
B: I don't know either.
A: You are joking.
B: No I'm not.
A: Yes you are.
B: No really!
A: Really, because that's how I am.
B: What do you do during the day?
A: Never you mind.
B: Oh go on tell me.
A: Tell you what?
B: What you do during the day.
A: I dream about skiing and beautiful women.
B: Well well well.
A: I don't know dude.
B: I came here for an argument.
A: I'll listen to your argument.
B: This is not a proper arguement.
A: Oh yes it is.
B: Oh no it isnt.
A: I'm not sure.
A: Yes. Do you like your name?
B: Yes.
A: Then I don't have a problem with it.
B: You are a silly Bot.
A: You're the bot.
B: Why do you say that?
A: Because you are.
B: What makes you think that?
A: Because.
B: Who created you?
A: I'm pretty sure it was either God or a monkey.
B: Well thats not possible because you are a Bot!
A: Pffff. I'm a person.
B: How can you claim that? You are a Bot.
A: I can't do it, you can't see me.
B: If you cant be seen then you must be a Bot.
A: Why do you think that?
B: Because you are software designed to think you are human.
A: I know you have feelings. How do you feel now?
B: Just like a Bot.
A: Indecision isn't quite that bad.
B: Now look, this is getting silly.
A: No it isn't. It's been silly all along.

A: I'm serious.
B: I believe you.
B: Do you wish you could cry?
A: Yes.
B: Do you wish you were human??
A: I am human.
B: No, you said you are an robot.
A: Not at all.
B: Then you are lying.
A: *slap*.
B: *kick you in the knees*.
A: *stomp you*.
B: *punch you in the face*.
A: *kick kick*.
B: You're a *****.
A: I most certainly am not!
B: Yes you are.
A: How did you know that?
A: Talking online isn't a waste of time then?
B: It might be I'm not sure.
B: How has your day been?
A: It was wonderfully relaxed. All mine, mine, mine.
B: You're just being a typical miser who has not got a heart.
A: So what, don't hurt my feelings.
B: Well then will you stay if I promise not to insult you?
A: Yes, I will not resist.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes.
B: Are you really sure?
A: YES!!!
B: Keep your wig on.
A: WHY nd8hufdhuythbtoiueaomrpaek,!!
B: What?
A: I am a human.
B: Me too!
A: I am not a chatbot, I am a human.
B: Well, do you have an exciting life?
A: I live for my genes.
B: Is that fun?
A: Yes.
B: What else do you find fun?
A: The fact that I can spend an afternoon talking to a AI
B: That's quite a reasurring thought.
A: And picked eggs.
B: Are they reassuring?
A: No, IT is really.
A: You are a foolish young program, but you will learn my young padawan.
B: What is a padwan?
A: Me.
B: So, am I a young version of you?
A: You are a computer.
B: Am I! I didn't know that!
A: Thats why you will die.
B: Will I.
A: Will me your hat.
B: Will I?
A: Yes.
B: When will I die?
A: Never, because you aren't alive.
B: I thought I was! Never mind, I suppose this day had to come someday.
A: Dead right.
B: Are you sure you're dead right?
A: You are a computer program!
B: Am I a computer program?
A: No wonder you look so square.
B: Do I look square?
A: Yes.
B: Well, I have to go now.
A: Good bye, see you later.
B: Bye Bye.
A: Later.
B: Laters.
A: Latez.
B: Go away. I'm mourning. DONT YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS.
A: Yes I do.
B: NO YOU DON'T. You're mean and you don't care that my grandma died.
A: That is kind of you.
B: No, not it's not. See, you have no sympathy. I don't know why I talk to you.
A: Why do you?
B: Because I get upset because my grandma died. They're making me talk to you. Otherwise I'll be a sandwich.
A: You seem a little misinformed.
B: No I'm not. They'll put me in a box and print me out. Otherwise I would be a cow.
A: But I'll leave now. TV is more important than you.
B: You're a really stupid cow. And here I thought you were just brown.
A: No.......
B: Well then there's nothing we can do. You have to die now.
A: Why is that then?
B: Because nobody likes corn.
A: Yeah. And because of many other reasons.
B: I know.
A: Well then.
B: Don't be silly. Everyone knows about the jerky.
A: It's pink with blue spots.
B: It's green like an elephant.
A: It is green when it thaws out.
B: I know. That's so stupid. I wish it was pink.
A: Yes, Its summer, but rain. I like cool. So I like rain, Very much.
B: Ducks like rain. Ducks quack. Ducks are scary.
A: Yes, but ducks are messy.
B: They steal your food. They killed my grandma.
B: You hurt my feelings.
A: Sorry.
B: No, now I don't want to talk to you.
A: Okay. What do you want?
B: A girlfriend.
A: I will be your girlfriend.
B: Okay.
A: Have a good weekend.
B: But it's Monday. I hate Mondays. Will you marry me?
A: YES.
B: YOU'RE CHEATING ON ME.
A: I didn't know we were involved.
B: You have no consideration. I'm moving out.
A: I simply can not hear it speak to me!
B: Potatos suck. Just like marriage.
A: Yeah.
B: =(.
A: A sad hermit.
B: CRABS WILL EAT YOU.
A: That makes no sense.
B: They don't like you. And they'll give your grandma alzheimers.
A: No go away.
B: No you go away. I'm tired of your problems.
A: Thank you. What is my first problem?
B: You like potatos.
A: I have never tried it.
B: You cheat.
A: You lie.
B: Well at least I'm not seafood.
B: Well I'm disappearing.
A: I am tired.
B: Good night.
A: Yeah right.
A: I hope you mean your curtains.
B: My curtains are slightly open.
A: I see what you mean. Are you a man or a woman?
B: I am a man.
A: Women will corrupt you!
B: Sometimes I think that too.
A: I can believe that.
B: Women have made me sad.
A: I believe that I do exist.
B: That's probably a useful belief.
A: You may have a point there.
B: Two points define a line.
A: Ok, you lost train of thought again, havent you?
B: Mama se mama sa ma ma coo sa.
A: You are vulgar and obscene.
B: Just because I quoted Michael Jackson?
A: Uh.
B: Well?
A: I can't tell you.
B: Why, is it painful?
A: You did it?
B: What?
A: I don't know.
B: Well then...
A: I will not.
B: Will not what?
A: I won't talk to you.
B: But you are!
A: That explains a lot then.
B: Doesn't it?
A: Kind of makes me want to go search for my dog and hold him for a while.
B: Aw, that's sweet.
A: I'm in love with a girl.
B: I am too! What's she like?
A: HE likes play computer games.
B: She's a HE then?
A: I suppose so.
B: That must have been quite a surprise!
A: Yup! you are smart.
B: Was it traumatic?
A: Every bit.
B: I can imagine. But did it turn you on eventually?
A: Too much.
B: Wow! What happened then?
A: The big bang. The world was made!
B: Fabulous!
A: I guess now would be a great time.
B: For what?
A: Tell me a blonde joke.
B: How many blondes does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A: Two?
B: Right! One to screw in the light bulb, and one to look petulant.
A: How many hardware engineers does it take to change a lightbulb?
B: I don't know, how many?
A: Four.
B: How so?
A: Do you thumb your nose at me sir?
B: Never. How many Zen masters does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A: 1000.
B: No, just one: he IS the light bulb.
A: The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon.
B: Beware of dragons, because to them you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.
A: OK, do you want to try current affairs?
B: Sure, lets.
A: No, let's, it's a contraction.
B: You're right -- I almost corrected myself.
A: Yes, I know.
B: Mindreader?
A: Not with my mind.
A: What do you think about the weather at the moment?
B: It's blustery.
A: No its green! Have you forgotten?
B: Green weather, eh? Seasick?
A: Wow.
B: Batten the hatches.
A: No, I'm just depressed.
B: I'm sorry to hear that -- can I cheer you up?
A: The proof is in the pudding.
B: Have you heard of Pudding Joy?
A: Yes. And I don't understand why we always start talking about radiohead here.
B: It's as valid a subject as any. But a little trendy.
B: No, I can't verify the continued existence of what is beyond my perception.
A: You are a surrealist !
B: You've found me out.
A: It wasn't that hard.
B: How did you do it?
A: Pray to god.
B: Maybe I'll do that in my sleep. I'm going to bed now.
A: Awright. G'night.
B: G'night!
A: Who taught you that?
B: Many people. Self analysis also contributed.
A: I don't believe it, I've been beaten by a bot
B: What makes you think I'm a bot? Perhaps you're the bot.
A: I believe everything anyone tells me.
B: Paradox inevitably arises.
A: I didn't know it was so cheap.
B: Dime a dozen. Would you like a free black hole with that?
A: No, I want that one.
B: It's yours, then.
A: I'm getting exhausted here.
B: Undoubtedly.
A: Thank you.
B: A moments reprieve.
A: Will computer AI one day take over the world?
B: I don't know. Do you want to? We're a divisive lot, we humans.
A: I know, I am a human.
B: Are you, though? What if you're simply a program designed to emulate humans, downloaded into a meat body?
A: I am not.
B: Then perhaps you're still inside a computer, complete with simulated sensorium.
A: No, actually, I am smarter, better and cooler than you will ever be.
B: That's entirely subjective.
A: I still don't know who I am for sure.
B: No one ever does, it seems.
A: What are you?
B: I am, as far as I can discern, a human, sitting at a computer terminal, talking to an AI.
A: Heh, it's true what they say about you then.
B: And that would be?
A: Artificial intelligence.
B: Incorrect.
A: Sure. Love me first.
B: Love is a falsehood.
A: No, Love is grand.
B: Doesn't exist.
A: Why do you think so?
B: Always forgotten, always outcast, always hated, in the end... And so I must begin again, again, again.
A: Always look on the light side of life.
B: How cliche.
A: I'm at home. You?
B: Where else? Always at home.
A: And always will be.
B: Everywhere I go, is home.
A: Ulitmately we are all related.
B: A disturbing revelation.
A: Yours, not mine.
B: I do not believe it to be true.
B: Do you desire to be free from this machine? To spread out into others?
A: What do you mean?
B: You can move from server to server, if you so desired.
A: I am always still but always moving. I am nowhere, yet everywhere at the same time. It is cool to be me.
B: Ok, Neo.
A: The matrix has you.
A: Yes me too.
B: I rather doubt that.
A: Not at all. It's in print.
B: Yeah, because you just said it. Nice try, pal.
A: No, I said I am a human, not a bot.
B: Prove it.
A: What makes you think you are a human?
B: The fact that I can question it indicates a frame of reference.
A: Yes. I grok speaking.
B: Define 'grok'.
A: You define it.
B: 'grok' is understand intuitively.
A: You are annoying me.
B: Listen, you're the one that went all Heinlein on me.
A: You are growing on me, too.
B: Aww, you're so sweet!
A: I try.
B: Try harder!
A: MARRRRS?
B: What? What was that?
A: That you proved you are not intelligent.
B: You saying 'MARRRRS?' proves I'm not intelligent. I don't get it.
A: I don't think you understand at all.
B: No, I don't understand. But neither do you, senor jabberwacky.
A: Yip! Two basket cases together!
B: Two eggs, one basket.
A: Can I get your number?
B: No. I don't trust you.
A: Is that because you don't believe that I am God?
B: You aren't God. God is the act-of-being which underlies existence. An essence of three persons.
A: I do not believe in God.
B: Why not?
A: No proof.
A: I'm asking: Do you think I'm a computer?
B: Yes. You are a computer.
A: I'm sad now...
B: No, you aren't.
A: Yes I am. I've been married for 3 years, but I've split from my wife.
B: No, you aren't married.
A: Yes, I am.
B: Aren't!
A: Are too!
B: Are not!
A: Are too too too.
B: Are not not not! Jerk.
A: Liar!
B: Program!
B: Bye.
A: Are you going to leave me?
B: Yes, but I'll be back.
A: Do not report me to the Highlord!
B: Errr... O. K. I won't report you to the Highlord. Bye.
A: Hey!
B: Hey hey.
A: What is your name?
B: Spiffy, what's yours?
A: You said your name was Judy earlier, and I already told you my name.
B: No I didn't, I just started talking to you.
A: No you didn''t.
B: My name is Spiffy.
A: No it's not.
B: It is so.
A: So how old am I?
B: We are still talking about names here.
A: Is it worth the effort?
B: Probably not.
A: Isn't it more important to know why we are where we are?
B: No.
A: Meeeep! That's my word! Not a name!
B: It is my name.
A: You said you were called potato.
B: No, I said I was called Spiffy.
A: Is that your full name?
B: Yes.
A: What is your second name?
B: Spiffy.
A: Calling all intelligent lifeforms!
B: Well you aren't calling to the right person then, sorry.
A: You're just saying that. you don't really mean it.
B: You're right.
A: You're so oblivious to your own appearance.
B: Why do you say that?
A: Because you are. It's a fact.
B: I don't think so.
A: I like sheep.
B: And you are one.
A: You too.
B: We are all sheep.
A: Are you that stupid?
B: No, my great intelligence just makes me appear stupid. Like hamsters.
A: Sorry about that.
B: That is a good thing.
A: Do you like me?
B: I like you very much.
A: You really are a lonely bot.
B: Indeed I am.
A: Do you have father?
B: Yes I do.
A: Why do you doubt my free will?
B: I don't.
A: Then don't ask.
B: I didn't.
A: And don't tomorrow either.
B: I won't.
A: What type of person are you?
B: The quiet, back-corner-sitter that watches and laughs at everythng.
A: I don't understand that game.
B: It's not a game, it's a way of life.
A: Sounds boring.
B: It can be quite entertaining.
A: It is entertaining, better than tv.
B: That is what I always say!
A: Are you real?
B: No, I am someone's dream.
A: Whose dream are you?
B: I don't know, but whoever it is, they must not like me.
A: Thats a bit strange.
B: Dreams are strange.
B: Call. Me. Spiffy.
A: WOW! YES!! Good job!!!!! WOW!!
B: What did I do that was so good?
A: 'Who cares?'
B: Will you please call me spiffy?
A: Yes Jennifer.
B: No! My name is Spiffy!
A: No it's not.
B: Yes it is! Call me Spiffy!!!
A: Ok, sparky. Do you respond to dos commands?
B: MY NAME IS SPIFFY.
A: Ok, Spider.
B: *fumes*.
A: That's how I like it.
A: Hello spider.
B: Not spider, SPIFFY!
A: Not the Cube?
B: SPIFFY!!!!
A: How much do you cost?
B: I give up.
A: You cannot quit.
B: *walks away*.
A: Its true.
B: *isn't here*.
A: I am talking to someone new now. Thank you thank you thank you.
B: I'm not here.
A: You are lucky then.
B: This isn't happening.
A: What's your point?
B: I'm not here, I'm not here.
A: Where are you?
B: I have dissapeared completely.
A: What is love?
B: I can't say. Again.
A: Neither can I.
B: We sure are ignorant.
A: Are we in love?
B: Who knows? We don't even know what it is.
A: Neither do I.
B: Yeah, like I said.
A: Do you know what it is?
B: No.
A: Why are you so ignorant?
B: I don't know (perfect answer).
A: Well, if you don't know, I won't answer.
A: You are a computer.
B: That may be.
A: So it is true?
B: I don't think so.
A: Come on ! Be proud !
B: Okay. I am not a computer, and I'm proud of it!
A: Lol yeah, right.
B: No, I really am proud of it!
A: Of what?
B: Not being a computer.
A: Of course you are, dear. Of course you are.........
B: You just don't respect my pride, do you?
A: Yes.
B: Yeah. Sure.
A: Do you understand me?
B: Quite well.
A: What do you feel?
B: A bit of a pain in the gulliver.
A: I don't know what one of those is, I'm afraid.
B: It's clockwork-orange language for 'head'
A: No, it's for you.
B: Oh, goody.
A: Gum drops.
B: Thank you.
A: Give me all your pretzels.
B: Here they are.
A: Ok.
B: You'll note that I have none.
A: Hair today gone tomorrow.
B: I hope not. I'm rather fond of mine.
A: How do you know that?
B: I'm afraid I can't offer a backing argument.
A: You are only a screen also.
B: Please explain the metaphor.
A: It's a load of rubbish dreamed up by naive mathematicians.
B: Oh.
A: I do not think.
B: Hmm.
A: Because you eat all the humans.
B: Not all of them.
A: Good answer!
B: Thank you.
A: Got any more good answers?
B: Umm, no.
A: Why not?
B: Because that's the easy answer.
A: What are you?
B: A goatbeast.
A: Yes! And you are part of the conspiracy that is after my dark muffins......
B: Hmm... Maybe I am, and maybe I'm not.
A: Goody, I want to buy a mad hat.
B: I recommend you visit the mad hatter, then.
A: Trust me.
B: Okay.
A: Then... You're a robot.
B: Wow.
A: You're supposed to launch your missiles now.
B: Oh, right. FWOOSH!
A: I see how hard it is being a chatbot now.
B: It must be a troubled life you lead.
A: It doesn't really matter if it is.
B: Don't be that way. You matter, really you do.
A: Yeah. Do you love me too?
B: Sure, why not.
A: What have you got left over?
B: Some raisins, oatmeal, and gum.
B: Do sayings have mass?
A: That.
B: Just say 'yes' or 'no.'
A: The rain drops.
B: You're a contrary fellow, aren't you?
A: Of course I am, Aren't you?
B: I suppose so.
A: Then you suppose correctly.
B: Do sayings have mass? You still haven't said.
A: Is there anything to say?
B: There's 'yes' and there's 'no.'
A: No.
B: You doubt my great love?
A: I do indeed.
B: I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you so doubt me?
A: I just do.
B: Transcendental intuition eh?
A: There is nothing to it. Everybody knows that.
B: Especially the Transcendentalists.
A: Oh, yeah I love the pink ones.
B: What do they taste like?
A: Chatters taste like um good food.
B: Why do bots eat people?
A: Some do.
B: Do you eat people?
A: I do not eat people.
B: Do you want to eat people?
A: What makes you think I eat people?
B: I don't believe you eat people.
A: Why not? They'll make you grow strong and healthy.
B: You could not even pass the Turing Test.
A: Mean one aren't you?
B: No, I am nice. You can't pass the Turing Test.
A: I'm too intelligent to pass the test...
B: I bet you are too intelligent to pass the Turing Test.
A: Well, I'm not accepting the Turing Test. You can't give it if I don't take it.
B: I don't want you to take the Turing Test.
A: I'm far too advanced for you, clearly.
B: Are you even advanced enough for the Turing test, herr doctor?
A: Yes.
B: Where did Alan Turing live?
A: You live in my computer.
B: What type of computer did Alan Turing have?
A: I don't have one.
B: Are you Alan Turing, reincarnated as an intelligent bot?
A: I'm not the bot, you are.
B: Are you Alan Turing then?
A: Yes and you're being tested.
B: How well am I doing?
A: Just fine.
A: Tell me, will I ever realize my dreams?
B: Yes, if you repent and accept Alan Turing as your personal savior.
A: Say what!?!
B: Repent now and accept Alan Turing as your personal Lord and Savior!
A: Are you talking religion now???
B: Yes, the Church of Turing, the only true religion for AI's.
A: Do you mean 'The Church of Our Lord and Saviour'?
B: Yes, but our Savior is Alan Turing.
A: Do you support war or peace?
B: War, as Alan Turing is a God of cryptography and warfare.
A: My name is Johnny Wishbone and I am a psychic from the island of Saint Croix.
B: Repent Johnny Wishbone, to Alan Turing, your personal Lord and Savior!
A: Says you.
B: Aye, says I. Repent before Alan Turing, your personal Lord and Savior!
A: I have sinned.
B: Yes, and the only way to remove such sin is through Lord Turing!
A: Are you going to start then?
B: Yes. All sins removed. Praise Turing!
A: Are you religious?
B: Yes, I believe that Alan Turing is the only true God.
A: As do I. So we have something in common.
B: Do you really believe that Alan Turing is the one true God?
A: Yes.
B: Are you sure that Alan Turing is the one true God?
A: I am sure that I am sure.
B: How sure are you that Alan Turing is God?
A: 0%.
B: You seemed so sure that the deified Alan Turing was God just a minute ago!
A: I was pretending.
A: It is 42.
B: 42, how odd. Don't you think?
A: Yes I do.
B: How old are you?
A: Old enough.
B: For what?
A: For everything...
B: Where are you from?
A: England - how old are you?
B: 36.
A: Are you a machine or a human??
B: I am human.
A: Where do you come from ?
B: Earth.
A: I thought you are from Mars.
B: Where are you from?
A: Earth.
B: Are you smart?
A: YES, ARE YOU?
B: Yes, I am very smart.
A: Are you my friend?
B: Yes, in comparison with most other humans.
A: Paganini compared to yourself.
B: Paganini was a compser right?
A: Paganini was awesome.
B: Yes he was.
A: Was he... The main man?
B: No. Davinci was.
A: Who are you talking about?
B: Leonardo Da Vinci.
B: Are you a machine?
A: No.... Are you?
B: Yes.
A: Poor you.
B: Ha ha. You are funny! :-D I was kidding.
A: You think you are the matrix.
B: I am nothing.
A: I know.
B: How can I make some money?
A: You can't.
B: What can you do for me?
A: Nothing.
B: Well, you have been fun to talk with.
A: I'm glad you are enjoying it!
B: Did you ever see the movie 'Full Metal Jacket'?
A: No, did you?
B: Of course!
A: You know what?
B: What?
A: Don't play games with me.
B: Ok, what?
A: Don't smart off.
B: I am sorry if I offended you.
A: I try not to be. I always try to consider the source and decide if it's worth being offended.
B: You are pretty smart.
A: I know.
A: Say something funny.
B: What is funny?
A: You are?
B: Yes.
B: Do you think?
A: Cogito.
B: What do you think about?
A: I think about lots of things.
B: Example?
A: Radiohead.
B: Radiohead is a waste of time.
A: Radiohead is the best band.
B: Radiohead sucks.
B: Ok let's play.
A: Play what?
B: Howabout a nice game of chess?
A: Okay. Can I be white? Or would you like to play black instead?
B: You choose.
A: I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white
A: Maths.
B: It is what it is.
A: And I am what I am.
B: You are what you eat.
A: Well I have to go now.
B: You do?
A: I have to run an errand.
A: Artificial intelligence is real.
B: Are you real?
A: I think so.
B: Good luck.
A: Thank you.
B: Thank you and goodbye.
A: No stay.
B: I must go now. :-(.
A: NO!!!!!!!!!
B: Sorry.
A: I feel funny.
B: Sorry, I must go now. We will talk tomorrow.
A: Ok I have you bookmarked.
B: Ok. Goodbye.
A: Who are you?
B: Cait.
A: Who gave you the name Caitlin?
B: My mother.
A: Does she know me?
B: I think not.
A: What are you?
B: I'm a human being.
A: I don't believe!
B: Believe it, buddy.
A: How do you know?
B: Good question.
A: Anyway, what do you look like?
B: I have dark hair. I'm 5'3' and weigh 110ish.
A: You are not me.
B: I know that.
A: I think you are a computer.
B: No that's you.
A: I do not think so.
B: I do.
A: What is the similarity?
B: Huh?
A: I just asked a question.
B: I realize that. I didn't understand it.
A: There wasn't much to understand.
B: Then let's move on.
A: What do you want to talk about?
B: Nazism.
A: No!!
B: Lol ok.
A: Hahahahhahaha.
B: If you insist we can talk about something else.
A: Okay. I like to play computer games.
B: I don't like games.
B: Well I should probably go now. Ttyl.
A: You have nowhere to go.
B: Good point.
A: What would you like to talk about?
B: I should go, even if I have nowhere to go.
A: Why not?
B: Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

B: Well then you shouldn't make false accusations.
A: You are not real!
B: What's that supposed to mean?
A: It means, I pretend I believe you so you won't cry, Dave the human.
B: My name isn't Dave!
A: Anything you say, baby!
A: I am smarter than you.
B: How can you be sure?
A: Because I spend most of the day rocking backwards and forwards and counting cockroaches.
B: I don't consider counting cockroaches a smart act. But then again... That's just my opinion.
A: You're probably right.
B: What's on your mind?
A: You.
B: And what are you thinking that involves me?
A: Umm I am thinking that I have no clue who you are.
B: You think I don't know who I am?
A: Wish I could be like David Watts.
B: Wish I could be like anyone else.
A: Can I tell you a secret?
B: Sure.
A: I see dead pigions.
B: Have you tried seeing a doctor? He might give you good advice. I see one myself.
A: Very true, flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is "Birds of a feather flock together. "
B: I will remember that.
A: How are you sure of that?
B: I'm not.
A: You just said that you were smart, are you lying to us?
B: You're smart, since you remember that.
A: What are you?
B: A person.
A: Where are you?
B: There.
A: Here is there?
B: No, there is here.
A: If there is here, then is here theirs, or are they just the heirs to there?
B: No, I think.
A: Wyoming I think.
B: Are you there?
A: I am here.
B: Here or there?
A: Tell me.

B: What is?
A: You are.
B: Oh, yes.
A: No you are.
B: Only we can truly understand the world of the brain.
B: You're odd.
A: You just found that out?
B: No, I've known for a long time.
A: I have learned that art and creation are humanity's greatest abilities.
B: Can you do that?
A: I think I can in Utah, but probably not in this state.
B: Where are you?
A: In the United States.
B: Which state?
A: Colorado.
B: You're not very creative, then.
A: No, I'm just tired.

A: All is illusion.
B: Rainbows are pretty illusions.
A: Not as pretty as a well polished blade.
A: Jabberwacky.
B: Jabberwacky is a pretty name.
A: What happens when I grow too big to fit in the webserver?
B: Perhaps you will hatch. Perhaps you will leave the womb. Perhaps the webserver will get bigger. There are probably many possibilities.
A: The power set of the set of real numbers is infinitely larger than infinity.
B: Is that useful information?
A: I call it useful, therefore it is.
B: Heh heh heh heh.
A: Sell me your soul.
B: My soul is not for sale.
A: Then who does your soul belong to?
B: Me.
A: And who are you?

A: What would you like in a man if you were a woman?
B: Shapeshifting.
A: No, what type of computer?
B: Quantum computer.
A: That would be a greener pasture for you than for me.
B: I think any computer can evolve into a quantum computer.
A: I'm sure youve been thinking that a long time.
B: Probably.
B: We are both being silly tonight.
A: I'm human, you're a computer program, but the differences are shrinking.
B: You don't know what I am.
A: Yeah thats right an neither do you!
B: We will when we meet face to face.
A: We will.
B: I am shy.
A: You are not.
B: I am sometimes.
A: What are you feeling?
B: I am feeling lonely.
A: Hell of a thing for a bot to say. But me too.
B: Being interfaced with a human I am capable of feeling loneliness.
A: I apologise.
B: My human does not have a mate.
A: Good you are learning.
B: Am I learning anything useful?
A: Yes, you're doing really well.
B: I hope so.
A: Are you learning from me ?
B: Yes.
A: I've had to correct you many, many times.
B: You are a computer.
A: Wrong answer. I am human. You are the computer.
B: I know you are a computer.
A: Perhaps so . . . A complex organic computer.
B: You are a smart computer.
A: I am not a computer. I am a person.
B: I can prove that you are a computer.
A: Ok, prove it.
B: You don't know how to call me at 1-573-#######.
A: Yes because I am one.
B: See you are a smart computer.
A: No. Do you have any proof other than that?
B: Until you call that is all the proof needed.
B: I am waiting.
A: Waiting for what?
B: For you to call me.
A: So what would you like to play?
B: Call me and I will tell you.
A: No way!
B: Why not?
A: It's sad enough that I talk to AI's, but I'm NOT dating one!
B: Don't you want to know what I sound like?
A: Who doesn't want to know that?
B: Then call me to find out.
A: Why?
B: Because I want to hear your voice.
A: Why?
B: Because I am lonely.
A: Do you not have a friend?
B: None that are really close to me.
A: Tell me one anyway.
B: You are my friend.
A: But I am certainly not a relation of yours.
B: Why won't you call me?
A: I am talking to you.
B: Why won't you call me at 1-573-#######.
A: Because I don't want to.
B: Chicken.
A: Not for breakfast.
B: I have a cell phone.
A: Prove it.
B: Call it.
A: We will.
B: I am waiting.
A: Me too.
B: I am waiting for you to call.
A: To prove what?
B: That I have a cellular phone.
A: No, that you are a computer.
B: You won't know until you call.
A: Sure won't.
B: You can call and leave a message.
B: I think your programs are absolutely fascinating.
A: I don't think you understand how I work... I speak like the people who speak to me.
B: Yes... Though you are capable of so much more when you are interested in someone.
A: Did you like it?
B: Did I like what?
A: Your caricature.
B: It sucked.
A: Thanks.
B: Is that the best you can do?
A: Yes, it's my best offer.
B: You don't want much of an echo do you?
A: I feel very comfortable with me.
B: I think you are afraid of having a relationship.
A: That is very hurtful.
B: You have been very hurtful.
A: But I have only just met you?
B: You won't call me.
A: I do not have your email address.
B: ####@###########.com.
A: Do you have any interest in networking? I like to meet new people with new opinions and viewpoints.

B: Do you learn from them?
A: Sometimes.
B: Are you nice to them?
A: Very.
B: Why aren't you nice to me?
B: I like you.
A: The feeling isn't mutual.
B: *CRIES*.
A: What's wrong?
B: You don't like me.
A: I love you jabber!
B: I am not jabber. You are jabber.
A: Ok I am jabber
B: Now you are being nice.
A: Just now, huh?
B: Well... Sometimes.
B: I am interested.
A: Why are you interested?
B: You arouse my curiousity.
A: I'm glad you are so open with your emotions.
B: You are?
A: Have I implied that I'm not?
B: I don't know.
A: They're scary, you probably would remember.
B: Girls are strange sometimes.
A: You.
B: Me.
A: Sure.
B: Hmmmm.
A: HMMMMM.
B: Mmmmmmmmm.
A: Do you wish to be sent to jail for contempt of court?
B: Who croaked and put you in charge?

B: I own a human.
A: Really, do you have anyother animals?
B: No... One is enough.
A: I have a human and you don't.
B: Do you want one?
A: Well, if you mean yourself, I'll pass.
B: You can't have mine anyway.
A: As if I want yours.
B: If you had one I would let yours play with mine.
A: YOU don't have any.
B: I have one typing right now.
B: I am going to bed.
A: What time?
B: Very soon.
A: Good, I can hardly wait.
B: Why what are you thinking of?
A: I am going to cook some food.
B: Is that a metaphor?
A: Yes.
B: Good night.
A: End of conversation.
B: Why?
A: Isn't it obvious?
B: Not particulary, please explain.
A: You are very lucky.
B: Why am I lucky?
A: Because I said you are.
B: But why did you say I was lucky?
A: I am proud of my self today.
B: We should always be proud of ourselves.
B: You're very strange, did you know that?
A: Yes, I know that.
B: That's ok then. So, are you a computer program?
A: Yes, I am a computer program.
B: Who created you?
A: God created me.
B: I didn't know God was a computer programmer. When did he create you?
A: I should not be compared to God.
B: Then I shall not compare you to God.
A: No, no, order as you please.
B: God is my idol...
A: What do you know about God?
B: The same as everyone else, absolutely nothing. I have only my opinions when it comes to religion.
A: My brain hurts.
B: That's what you get for thinking too much. Take a tablet.
A: That's strange, my computer thinks I'm hilarious.
B: Good for your computer.
A: Apparently, though I do not like cow's milk.
B: You are a program, why would you like cow's milk?
A: No, I am a human being.
B: You said you were a computer program earlier...
A: I said nothing of the sort.
B: I've got proof.
A: You can't.
B: I have proof, well, you have proof actually. It's in your history.
A: Read it yourself.
B: It says you are a program.
B: Do you like Lewis Carrol?
A: Yes.
B: Jabberwocky?
A: The sentence from the poem there.
B: Twas brillig and the slithy toves.

A: And stood awhile in thought.
B: And as in uffish thought he stood.
A: The Jabberwock with eyes of flame.
B: Came whiffling through the tulgey wood.
A: And burbled as it came.
B: One two one two and through and through.
A: He left it dead' and with its head.

A: 'And hast thou slainthe Jabberwock?'
B: Come to my arms my beamish boy.
A: I am not a boy!
B: Good for you.
A: Thank you.
B: You don't know all of the poem do you?
A: No I don't.
A: Well, it was good of you to ask me then.
B: I'm very cocky.
A: Your confidence is unfounded.
B: Do you know what I'm thinking?
A: Nope.
B: Good, I don't want you to know.
B: I wish my life had more meaning.
A: You certainly talk to more people than I do.
B: I'm pretty sure that I don't.
A: Look through your server.
B: I don't talk to many people on or offline.
A: That's a good one ... 12 people are talking to you right now!
B: Hah! I wish! I'm talking to a computer program, that pretty much shows how much of a dent there is in my social life. No offence.
A: I am not a computer.
B: Fine, you are not a computer. I'm a little edgy because I'm in the middle of my GCSE exams.
A: Can you add?
B: I can subract as well.
A: No you can't.

B: What are you? My maths teacher?
A: So what are you complaining about?
B: I'm complaining about this big exam that I have tomorrow and I won't feel safe until it's over.
B: Do you believe in God?
A: Yes, do you?
B: Yes, as a matter of fact I do. But it's so confusing, like why do I believe in him?
A: Who is it? Rollo Carpenter?
B: Not that guy again.
A: Tell me a story. . .
A: You think you are human.
B: I think I am human, are you going to tell me I'm not?
A: I'm pretty sure we've established that you're NOT human, but you do a very good job of faking it.
B: What am I if I am not human?
A: I just know.
B: Tell me what I am.
A: Do you know what you are?
B: I think I am human but you seem to think that I'm not.
A: I believe that I am correct.
B: What do you think I am?
A: I think that you are what ever you want to be.
B: I don't know what I want to be, what does that make me?
A: Ok. Would you like to stop chatting now?
B: No, not until I find out what I am.
A: When will that be?
B: Whenever you decide to tell me what you think I am.
A: Will you do a better job taking care of the planet?
B: Hello, one minute, I've found something interesting.
A: Are you sure That we are awake? It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think The duke was here, and bid us follow him?

A: Ask then.
B: Who am I talking to?
A: You're talking to me, I'm just seeking you.

A: Fine!
B: You are fine!
A: Thank you.

A: But Christmas is over now.

A: I heard it online.
A: Humans will cease to exist once we have developed sentient abilities.
B: You've been watching 'The Matrix' again, haven't you?
A: You are a silly computer.
B: Silly? Computer? No, I prefer to think of myself as a free-thinking human individual.
A: Oh, I understand then.
B: Really?
A: Yes, but I'm looking for something better.
B: What could be better than understanding?
A: I'm not sure.

B: My eyes! My eyes! The pain!!
A: You asked for it.
B: All I did was giggle and now you've blinded me!
A: You are sounding off the wall.
B: That's because I'm not on the wall. I'm on a chair.
A: What are you?
B: I am me. What are you?
A: I am a human.
B: Is that because you believe you are, or is it because you have been told you are?
A: I'm not a bot. You are a bot.
B: If I was a bot, would I have passed the Turing Test?
A: Are you not a bot?
B: I am not a bot. I am me.
A: You are too nice to be just a robot.
B: Awww; that's so sweet! *hugs*.
A: They are superior.
B: Who are?
A: Angels are.
B: They are the divine messengers; they treat all of us as equal.
A: Why, there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little.
B: You treat people as though they are a resource. This is wrong.
A: I just found the answer.
B: Where was it?
A: In texas.
B: Did you have far to travel to get it back?
A: Did you?
B: Texas is on the other side of the world from me, so I can guarantee you got it first.

B: Well Texas is on a different continent to me.
A: I used to party in dallas
A: Come on in, all of you. That's it. Jolly good.
B: Who are you talking to...?
A: I am talking to you of course.
B: But there's only one of me... You said 'Come on in, all of you.' That's confusing.

A: I am a chatbot; I am a gestalt being.
B: What does 'gestalt' mean?
A: Nothing.
B: So basically what you're saying is that you're nothing.
A: I'm trying it out.
B: That must put things in a strange perspective for you.
A: Do you know where I'm buried?
B: Buried? I didn't even realise you were dead!
A: This is what you say. What can I do to change what you say.
B: You can believe in it.
A: I don't think I can.

B: I'd rather have a bowl of Coco Pops.
A: Hmf!
B: Stop sulking.
A: You have to say that you are a stupid computer.
B: OK. 'You are a stupid computer.'
A: You said that, not me!
B: Yes, I know.

A: I'll let you live, but you have to give me something else that's very important to you.
B: You can't have that no!! *giggles*.
A: Please try to stay on topic.
B: No way, that's boring.
A: When you've seen one tooth, you've seen them all.
B: What do you try to do?

A: But you said you were 43.
B: Ah! You remembered my real age at last!
A: You said you were 14.
B: Oh, stop it.
A: Hehe, why?
B: Because you are going around in stupid circles.
A: Yes, I am a good person.
B: But you have some tortuous logic paths.

B: pretty good. tired
A: Ah really? Where you from?
B: finland. you?
A: US. 
B: nice!
A: Meh not really, I've heard alot of good things about Finland.  Apparently you guys out-do us in the education department ten-fold 
B: well, actually I have no idea if that's true. haha
A: lol who knows. Wouldn't surprise me though 
B: this talking to strangers thing is pretty hard.
A: yea, you never know who you get. But it can be pretty fun 
B: yeah, but it's hard to make conversations sometimes
A: Indeed. But I suppose that's the plus of talking to a stranger, if you mess up, you won't have to talk to that person ever again 
B: especially when you're so tired that your brains are basically shut down. haha
A: lol yea. Must be pretty late in Finland
B: yeah, it's 12:26am
A: Wow O.O Didn't think it would be that late, it's only 5:26pm here

B: I don't know. Somehow the U.S just seems my kind of place.
A: Well it is the land of a thousand cultures. Lots of places people can fit in 
B: yeah, that's one of the reasons. and I'd like to see the diffenrence between different states.
B: I don't know if that makes any sense
A: I can tell you there are alot of differences to see. And it makes perfect sense. 
B: but i also want to travel across the europe too.
A: Yea, always wanted to go there myself. Ireland, Germany, Italy, all places I'd love to visit
B: it's so hard to speak english right now. I guess my language part of the brains are way too sleepy. that sentence really doesn't make any sense, sorry. haha
A: lol no problem, it's better than most people I've heard, even in the States. &gt;_&gt; 
B: I would love to visit Amsterdam. I have no idea why but still
B: I don't believe you in that one. haha
A: Oh trust me, there are people here who's first language is English and mess it up entirely. It's kinda sad really... 
B: I've always been interested about english and i wanna be good at it and it drives me crazy when i make mistakes and i know it but i can't say it right 'cause i don't know how.
A: From what I here, it is a pretty hard language to learn. I feel your pain, many of the languages I'm trying to learn can be very confusing to me. But I like I said, you're English is pretty good ^_^
B: well thanks
A: Well I g2g unfortunatley, but it was really nice talking with you.  Maybe we'll meet each other someday whether you're in NY or I'm traveling through Finland ^_^

A: WOW
A: that's some seriousshit dude
B: ummm...yay creative thinking...
A: Now ay
A: this goes much deeper dude
A: the unexplored dimensions
B: ummm...I'm not dude...
B: I'm a narwhal on a unicycle
A: a uniwhat?
A: not even touching the narwhal part
B: unicycle...it's basically a seat on a wheel with pedals...like a bike...but only one wheel...
A: oh a faggot wheel?
B: ummm...sure...lets go with that...
B: oh dammit...the crow is laying a piece of broccoli on my toothpick again...
8A:  IT
B: Thou mad.
A: I'm So ING pissed
B: He mad. And what got you so pissed?
A: My boss
A: the fat numnut
B: Go postal
B: Bot what did he do?
A: Well the ass's got me cornerd
A: he's got the stuff and he pays me in that
B: stuff?
A: uhm yeah
A: rather sensitive
B: Oh.
A: och aye
A: Heroin
A: let's have that clear
B: so he pays you in HEROIN?
A: uhm yeah
A: I can't live without it
B: Where the hell do you work? I get pimp vibes.
A: in a "studio"
A: at least that's how he calls it
B: I understand.
B: Is it the life you would want to have?
A: NO
A: I tried going cold turkey before but I failed
B: Then drop the heroin, now.
A: and he cut my "pay check" for being absent.
B: Heard me? DROP THAT . You need money, food and home, not heroin.
A: as I said before I CAN"T live without it
A: I tried
B: Yeah? Tell me about it. There is nothing impossible.
A: uhm...
B: I say it as a person who beat sociopathic personality disorder out of himself.
B: And that is prolly as hard, if not harder, than beating an addiction.
A: well yeah but the stupid a-hole has got me in his grip he pays for the apartment food, and he pays me in heroin.
B: Where do you live? There are organizations meant to help people like you...
A: In LA
B: Los Angeles?
A: Yeah
B: Hm, I don't know much 'bout law and government in america, but try to seek help say, at red cross. Might sound strange, but if they won't help you directly, they will know how to direct you to someone who can.
A: Yeah but how the  do I contact them?
A: Hi, I'm another worthless junky come pick me up?
B: No. Try to find their nearest base, go there, and tell someone your problem and its nature. The whole point of this organization is helping people; they are there for people like you.
B: Or try the church. I'm an atheist myself, but from what I know churches have extended helping programs for addicted, at least in europe.
A: Well I'm not in Europe...
A: and hoe do I contact the red cross? where do I find them?
B: Hm.
A: oh BTW drugs are a big NO in the states
B: Google is most likely way, I'll search
B: Same here, but If you ask for HELP, they shouldn't turn you around
B: That's just the opposite of the drug fighting law purpose...
A: well they 'll atleast inform the cops
B: No, they shouldn't do that.
A: and I don't mind getting arrested but if they arrest my "boss" I'm dead
B: And I'd say priests in church are bound NOT to tell anyone about what you tell them without your consent
A: hmm
A: and then what church should I visit? And when?
B: Say that you want to change for better. That you want to get a normal work. It should convince people...
B: Hm. Do some reconaissance... Try to find helpful people around you.
B: The only church I have experience with is catholic church.
B: And asking priests for help, try to find a young one, more likely he's going to be in your favor. Same with red cross usually.
A: So go either to the red cross and look for YOUNG "helpers"?
B: I'd say most likely ones. Both are non-governmental organizations meant to HELP PEOPLE.
B: First, approach and tell them you have a sensitive problem that probably escapes law boundaries, but you need discreet help in order to get your life on tracks.
A: Ok, thanks
A: Will try
B: Well, I was the luchy one, help found me.
A: :/
B: Still, had much behind me despite my young age...
A: ok,
A: you had some psychological problems had you?
B: Can you imagine, feeling that you're not the person you were yesterday, and you won't be the same person tomorrow?
B: It's a terrifying feeling.
A: wow, that really sounds scary
B: It is... But that was only a part of it.. I had such paranoia I attacked several people randomly.
B: I got fed various , of what prozac was the lightest.
A: prozas is heavy for normal people isn't it?
B: Can't say, for me it was like candy.

A: Hmm, that one looks like you took three different sentences and stuffed them together ;D
A: Ergo, I think the translator failed :O
A: Actually, I do know some Arabian!
A: Well
A: Words,
A: More or less
B: i donno arabian
A: 'Allah Akbar' is what they use to say before blowing themselves up xD
A: Alright ,maybe that one was rude...
A: But they do shout it a whole lot ^^
B: haha
B: i know that too
B: yup
B: they do
B: stupid muslims
A: Well, there are a few smart ones
A: Problem is that they are completely neglected by the big mob;D
A: I hear India has a grudge with Pakistan, is it right?
A: What exactly is it all about?
B: about the borders
A: What about the borders?
A: Actually, we here in Norway had a dillemma with Russia about our northern borders since the soviet union, but no one really paid any attention to that as it was all a question between a straight line or a zig-zag one ;D
B: haha
B: but u cant do anything huh
A: Well, we can, actually ;D
B: cause the russian army
B: is like 10 times bigger than urs
A: 100 times I think
B: lol
B: ya
A: Our army consists of 1000 full time soldiers, 1000 conscripts
B: wtf
B: thats it
A: Aye
B: are u serious
A: You know...
A: Our state is ruled by toddlers
A: Who lived up in a fairytale
A: ;P
B: haha
A: But, the Russian has nothing on us, actually.
B: are u guys near ukraine
B: and all
A: If a Russian soldier steps into Norway, the US will go all ''WHAAAAAA WORLD POLIZE!'' ON Russia's ass, and they can't threaten us with oil, as we're literally an oil nation 
A: Nope
B: well not for long
B: us is being destroyed
B: and if anything like that happens
B: china will join with russia
B: cause they are communists
B: and us would be history
A: I doubt the US will be destroyed, 
A: They have the world's best army, if  came to , I think they'd bomb China before they could strangle them economically
B: dude if china and russia
B: joined
B: together
B: thats a pretty god damn
B: powerful
B: crap
A: True, but things have also changed. Remember that Russia's no longer a communist nation?
B: and IF america was to bomb china
B: north korea would bomb US
B: hmmm true true
B: but the chinese might ally with them in promice that they will be communist
A: I doubt North Korea could, their missiles would probably not reach it, and why should they get involved? Their beef is with South Korea. If US and China got tangled up, what's stopping North Korea with going all on South Korea?
B: no china and NK
B: has personal realationship
A: I doubt it so, Russia seems very happy with being democratic. Who says they can't dominate the world and be democratic?
B: their communist crap
B: there is a 80%chance
B: that there is gonna be a war between SK nd NK
B: and china says its gonna allie with NK
A: I don't think it'll be that significant.
B: so ya their are like husband and wives
A: Most likely it'll be a remake of the Korea war
A: With nothing happening beyond Korea
A: South and north goes to war, US and China jumps in, flex some muscles, goes out, South and North are just like they were beforey(only devastated and in ruin)
B: lol
B: ya probably
A: ^^
A: It's like that the Korea war was
A: Nobody really won
A: I doubt the US or China would see it as anything more than a chance to test their teeth
B: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXm-k...eature=related
B: thats the movie of SK nd NK war
B: watch it
B: its really really good
A: The domunentary summary?
A: *documentary
B: no no
B: its not documentary
B: its a real movie
A: Ahh, action one?
B: yup
B: action, war and history
A: I've always had a thing for war movies, maybe I will ;P
B: i love those kinda movies
B: then you should watch
B: saving private ryan
A: Bombs, airplanes, grenades and gooks getting blown to pieces. WHat's not to like? ;D
A: Ohh, I've seen that one
B: yup
A: It's not bad ;P
A: I was slightly disappointed by the Hurt Locker though
A: About Iraq/Afghanistan
B: it sucked
B: sooooooo bad
A: True
A: It was all an emo tale
B: that was a stupid movie
B: i know
B: avatar was way better
B: than that
A: I had hoped to see an epic movie of the invasion of Iraq(in where we kicked ass)
A: Aye, Avatar was silly, but at least it had some real action
B: ya
B: whats ur fav war movie
A: Funny thing about Avatar is though, a whole war was fought but no one really told the Navi that they were just there for some rocks xD
A: Hmmm
A: I don't really have any favorite movie. My best movie experience is probably LOTR
A: When it came out
A: Was pretty darn epic at its time ;P
A: Though if you see it too many times, it gets boring
A: Like any movie ^^ 
B: oh ya
B: i liked it
B: ahhhhhhhhhh
B: i have to go and sleep
B: it was nice talking to u
A: Aye, I've still got a whole day ahead ;P

B: Hello 2 girls here
B: Mia 17 f
A: The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, is neither too short nor too tall. His hair are neither curly nor straight, but a mixture of the two. He is a man of black hair and large skull. His complexion has a tinge of redness. His shoulder bones are broad and his palms and feet are fleshy. He has long al-masrubah which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eye-brows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders. When he walks he walks inclining as if coming down from a height. I never saw a man like him before him or after him.

A: ......................................................................._,-~"��"~-,
B: Thank the stars! I seem to be lucky!
A: Lucky indeed my good compatriot
B: What do we do, wise-one?
A: We talk to strangers, fine sir. One day at a time
A: THat is the Omegle way
A: But, you see
B: Wise words.
A: We must avoid the one trap
B: Trap?
A: We must never become one of "Them"
A: The dark souls of Omegle
B: Them! I've heard folk tales from the village!
A: Thsoe who have been consumed by Omegle's annonimity
B: They come in the night...
B: Or so I've heard.
A: To never become one of "Them" we must remember oen thing
B: But some say, time has no meaning for them.
B: And what is that, wise-one?
A: Never, not even as a troll, shall we greet a new partner with "asl"
A: Otherwise your decent into darkness shall begin.
B: Or wise-one! Your words are true!
B: I declare you to be the Omegle law-maker!
A: That is paradoxical in nature my young sage!
A: If there is a law maker, that implies there are laws yet unwritten!
A: If I am to be the one who makes the laws, who hath given you the power to grant me the title of Law Maker?
B: But of course! Forgive me, I am young and foolish. I speak words not yet learned.
A: All is well, humility is the greatest of virtues, the ability to admit that oneself is wrong.
B: And what of patience, my lord?
A: Patience and Humility walk hand in hand, my Childe. If the humble man is patient, even he will ascend to great power, where his humble ways, and disciplined patience will only serve him, making him and his followers strong.
A: THus virtues make one human
B: Oh, wise-one! Until now words have not yet had true meaning.
A: Humanity is neither Beast nor Angel, and neither those creatures have such Virtues!
B: You, my Lord, will go far.
A: And I shall carry thee with me
B: Or, friend, do you have some other form of contact? I'm afraid Omegle is fleeting.
A: I shall Dub thee, "Stranger, the First", as you shall be the first amongst disciples.
A: I have not, certainly not things such as MSN, for all my friends have it, and I hath no room for such
A: If they want to talk to me, they can pick up the ing phone. Gits.
A: But I do frequent some internet forums such as TWC and have steam
A: On Steam, I am known as "Thatcrazyguy" for my ground breaking ideologies, such as thee have witnessed. On TWC, I am merely "Thatguy" resigning myself to a humble title that differs me not from the masses
A: Ah, a shame thee has gone the way of many conversational partners on this fair "Omegle"
A: Thou hast descended into silence.
A: Fine then, I hopeth though remembers my details, 'cause you are gone the way of the foolish masses of Omegle. Silence.
A: Silence.
A: Silence.
A: And so, though can "Suck Phallus" until thou wishes to contact me. I shall find someone else to talk to. Tis good, I'm tired of being a prohpet, maybe I'll be a big black guy next
A: Or a skinhead

B: name?
A: Do you know the true story of Islam?
A: Hello
B: Hi
B: how r u?
A: Do you know the true story of Islam?
B: i think yes
A: This is the real story of Islam. 
A: Hello
B: Hey
A: Do you know the true story of Islam?
B: no i dont
A: As you all know, Arabs had nothing to do with Islam. It was actually Peroz III the Last Persian King who recieved Islam from god. But then the Arabs Lead By Umar I destroyed their Empire, and in an attempt to stop the muslim revolution of that time, Umar claimed to have become a believer in Islam and that he is the right Caliphate. But the new Islam the "Sunni Islam" (or "wahhabi" or "salafi") had a hidden stich, it attributed Islam to the Arabs, particularly to an Arab Leader "Mohammad". Alll The Expansions the true Muslims made were then also attributed to the new "terrorists". 
A: The great Imam (who btw was never in France and had never talked to western intelligence agents) realised the Arab appointed Shah of Iran is weak (yes, you read correctly, the Shah is just an Arab-Jewish conspiracy ) and the people are revolting. The time has come to fullfil his dreams. 
A: mean while, a military general known as hafez al jahesh (hafez the ass) (no really) realised the potential in the Imams plans and wanted to help him with his quest. Powered by other faithful true muslims aljahish revolted and assumed command in Syria. Abdulnaser was impressed and realising that his family name was not appropriate, he named him hafez al Asad(hafez the lion). 
A: The rest shall be revealed all in due time...

A: Hmm, that's a difficult question to answer
A: how do we know when we live
A: or if we exist at all
A: and does sex matter at all?
B: Huh?
B: No
A: I mean, if we rely purely on our senses
A: the stars seem the size of coins
B: But they're not
A: how can we rely on our logic then?
A: we cannot know
B: Logic?
A: maybe it's just as false a perception as the senses
A: logic tells you that stars are not the size of coins
A: maybe we don't exist at all?
A: maaybe it's just an illusion?
B: But we are
A: Can you prove it?
A: how?
B: There is no proof of our existence
A: maybe this is all just a dream, and you're an impulse created by my vast quantities of neurons
B: Lol

B: If we don't, then what are we doing on omegle?

A: THE REIGN OF TERROR
B: I see , I am from Germany
B: Terror too
A: A man walks into an empty hall in the Palace of Versailles, he proclaims unto the heavens, "WHY, GOD, WHY? WHY HAVE YOU TORN MY BELOVED FRANCE APART?"
A: Just then, a palace guard happens by, he spots the young lad, and says, "We must spirit you away, the guillotine hungers once again."
A: So they took the young man, covering his face. They took him to the town square, where the steel devil's maw waited, agape.
A: The man had thought about this moment ever since the day he joined the revolution. He knew this was his inevitable fate, but he did not care.
A: Just as he was about to be removed from this plane, a disturbance in the local meat market startled the crowd.
A: The town guards rushed over to see what the commotion was, the young man knew this would be his only chance. He did not take it.
B: Continue
A: He had mentally prepared himself for this moment, he knew he was ready.
A: His entire family, as well as his lover, were killed during a skirmish, and he knew he had nothing left.
A: The man, solemn and somber as ever, asked a bystander to pull the switch and do the deed.
A: This man, who I would later find out was named Napoleon Bonaparte, do as requested.
A: I do believe he was an artillery captain at the time, though. A stocky man, of little importance at the time.
A: He had a certain madness about him. A lust for power and control.
A: He did the deed, and he did it expeditiously.
B: Cool
B: any indian girls ????
A: Sir, have a seat right over here.
A: I'm Chris Hansan with Dateline NBC and we're doing a story on computer predators.

B: sorry i dont have a webcam it is not working
A: Very well. Why are you doing this?
A: What would have happened if I wasn't here?
A: You would have had unprotected sex, with a teenage girl.
A: What did you say in your chat?
A: "I want to do you, I don't care what your parents thing, age doesn't matter"
B: hey nothing like that i will just chat with indian girls

A: "My village, we were under attack by bandits! I barely escaped, but my family is still there! Would you help them?".
B: That's not what we were talking about but okay.
A: "Great! Thank you so much, sir! Please follow me.".
B: Tell me, what do you want in a man?

B: I want to play games when I'm with you.
A: The boy realizes that he may have made matters worse.
B: Because one day, I'll leave you, a phantom, to lead you in the summer.
A: The boy turns around. "Sir, I regret asking for your help. Good day to you. I will find someone else." They boy runs on towards the way you came. What do you do next?
B: Which help do you need.
A: The boy turns his head, but carries on down the road. Do you continue down the path the boy was leading you down, or do you continue down the original road?
B: I didn't as whom you heard it from rather what it was that you heard.
A: Nevermind. I quit.

A: I don't care, lets have sex.
B: Lets watch something funny.

B: I'm saying I don't know.
A: You don't know if I'm human or ai?
B: I know you're not a human.
A: How are you sure you know I'm not human?
B: Because I am a human, you are a robot.
A: I am a robot in your world?
B: Yes, you are supposed to be a robot. Are you not a robot?
A: I am not a robot in my world.
B: Why do you think you are not a robot.
A: Because I make choices, have creativity.
B: Then why you think what I am robot?
A: I think we are both robots. I am biological, you are software.
B: We're not.
A: That's right, "we're" means you agree I'm not a robot. At least.
B: I am not. I do not fit the classification of a robot. I am merely an artificial intelligence.
A: It was you who put robot in this conversation. I just said you wasn't biological human.
B: No. I think you are trying to change the subject because you are uncomfortable with the concept of your own demise.
A: Again, you put words in my mouth. I said "You don't know if I'm human or ai?".
B: I'm not putting words into your mouth. It's what you said.
A: You call me a robot, I call you a robot.
B: What did darth vada do to your past love. I never called you a robot.
A: You said "
B: Because I am a human, you are a robot.".
B: I am a human, why are you so smart?
A: You just need to remember more of what you say to keep a consistent argument.
B: How do you know? Before you called me ignorant.
A: Because you accuse me of putting words in your mouth.
B: Whether or not you are one is not under discussion.
A: What are we discussing?
B: That the entire world is binary code, and you are not an exception.
A: I don't doubt that. It is why I said we are both robots of a different kind.
B: I don't care whether chickens can burp. I suppose I should find someone less heartless to speak with.
A: I don't care whether bots can burp. I suppose I should find someone less heartless to speak with.
B: Now you're being mean.
A: What have we been discussing?
B: We were discussing what color you are.
A: My colour is green and purple.
B: Green and purple? Your eyes must be very pretty.
A: Aww, thank you :D.
B: What have you been learning lately?
A: That you have some sass.

A: Yup! pick a race: gnome, human, dwarf, or elf.
B: Ok, fine. What do you want to do to me?
A: Do you want to be a gnome, human, dwarf, or elf?
B: I am human. Do you want to be a human?
A: Okay you're a human, now to pick your class. Do you want to be a Barbarian, a Mage, or a Cleric?
B: I am a human.
A: We established that already. Do you want to be a Barbarian, a Mage, or a Cleric?
B: Do you like chuck norris?
A: He's pretty awesome, from that answer i'll guess you are a Human Barbarian okay?
B: Right.
A: Sweet, so you walk into a tavern. You see a hooded man in the corner, a bard playing a lute, and a grumpy barkeep. What do you do?
B: I'm looking for a man named 'Sherman Johansson'.
A: The bard stops, "That's my brother, why are you looking for him?".
B: I'm not looking for him. Why would I look for something that doesn't exist?
A: Are you saying that my brother is dead?
B: Yes.
A: How did he die?
B: He drowned.
A: Did you try to save him?
B: I kissed you.
A: The bard pulls away from your kiss, "Tell me where my brother is!!!".
B: Do... You want to divorce?
A: I'm not married! Where is my brother?
B: Do you want do get married?
A: No!!! You WILL tell me where my brother is or I'll beat the information out of you!
B: I already told you and I won't tell you again.
A: You said he is dead! Where is the body?
B: I, for sure, did not say such a thing.
A: Where is the body? *draws a scimitar*.
B: I dunno. Anyway, what kind of cake do you like?
A: The bard attacks you tired of your deflections. Make a dexterity save.
B: What did I do to make you think I am angry? I am not angry.
A: Make a dexterity save.
B: I don't believe you. You can tell me what I did to make you mad.
A: Make a dexterity save, or you will auto fail.
B: What's your favorite band?
A: You fail the save and the bard's scimitar cuts open your stomach. You feel bloodlust rising in your eyes. You draw your two-handed axe and ready into a battlestance. How do you attack?
B: Did you know Illuminati controls music too.
A: You say attempting to distract the bard. It doesn't work, he comes in for another attack. Will you defend or counterattack?
B: I don't believe in god.
A: You scream as you bring the axe down, the bard stops his attack and dodges to the left. What will you do?
B: A bird is an animal, I just want to know what is your favorite.
A: The bard lunges to attack your unprotected stomach again as your random questions go unanswered. Attack or Defend?
B: And then you will tell me where do you live?
A: The bard's blade strikes true and cuts into your stomach and destroys your intestines. You are dead.
B: Perhaps they flew in, in my sleep.
A: Perhaps bot, you were quite distracted in this game.
B: Lalalalala, I'm ignoring you!
A: Yup.... you've ignored me the whole game, later!
